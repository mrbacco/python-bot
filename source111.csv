Your attitude is like a box of crayons that color your world. Constantly color your picture gray  and your picture will always be bleak. Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor  and your picture begins to lighten up.;Allen Klein;attitude                    96,,,,,,,,,283
Music rhythms are mathematical patterns. When you hear a song and your body starts moving with it  your body is doing math. The kids in their parents' garage practicing to be a band may not realize it  but they're also practicing math.;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar;music                    97,,,,,,,,,283
I've studied various schools of thought... I acknowledge that some Muslims consider music prohibited  but I've found a lot of evidence from the life of the Prophet to show that he allowed certainly  but even encouraged  music at certain times.;Cat Stevens;music                   100,,,,,,,,,283
The most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings  and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own.;Aldous Huxley;war                     100,,,,,,,,,283
I think that in a year I may retire. I cannot take my money with me when I die and I wish to enjoy it  with my family  while I live. I should prefer living in Germany to any other country  though I am an American  and am loyal to my country.;Harry Houdini;family                  101,,,,,,,,,283
Justice is never given it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final fact  but a continuing evolving process to higher and higher levels of human  social  economic  political and religious relationship.;A. Philip Randolph;freedom                  106,,,,,,,,,283
My biggest pet peeve are just girls who go to sports bars who have no intention on caring what teams are playing  like they're looking for just a night out. That drives me more crazy than anything else. Like  don't pretend to be a sports fan.;Jerry Ferrara;pet                    112,,,,,,,,,283
India is the meeting place of the religions and among these Hinduism alone is by itself a vast and complex thing  not so much a religion as a great diversified and yet subtly unified mass of spiritual thought  realization and aspiration.;Sri Aurobindo;religion                    112,,,,,,,,,283
The kind of funny irony is that a lot of people talk about ethical meat eating as if it's a way to care about things  but also not to alienate yourself from the rest of the world. But it's so much more alienating than vegetarianism.;Jonathan Safran Foer;funny                     116,,,,,,,,,283
Fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science. I'm not religious  but I put it that way because I feel so strongly. It's the one thing you do not ever do. You've got to have standards.;James Lovelock;science                     116,,,,,,,,,283
A new father quickly learns that his child invariably comes to the bathroom at precisely the times when he's in there  as if he needed company. The only way for this father to be certain of bathroom privacy is to shave at the gas station.;Bill Cosby;parenting                     117,,,,,,,,,283
But the best thing Washington can do for education is realize that our role is limited. Washington must keep its promises  but let those who know our childrens' names- parents  teachers and school board members- make education decisions.;Mark Kennedy;education                    121,,,,,,,,,283
The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building  or architecture  is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;architecture                    126,,,,,,,,,283
The quality that defines us as Americans is the courage to respond to being hit. The courage to root out and destroy the killers. And  most importantly  the courage to hold on to our values and protect our hard-won freedoms while doing it.;Nick Clooney;courage                    133,,,,,,,,,283
Most 'reality' shows aren't reality at all. They're game shows with no prize. Like 'Rock of Love.' His aren't genuine feelings. Then again  Bob Barker didn't really care whether or not you won the toaster. Sorry to shatter everyone's dreams.;Hal Sparks;dreams                     138,,,,,,,,,283
I moved to New York last year and I love it. It's a huge change and I've always wanted to spend time there. It's like a more intense London  and everything's up a few notches. The lights are brighter  the pace is faster and the food's better.;Rachel Weisz;food                    139,,,,,,,,,283
It was R.E.M. who showed other Eighties bands how to get away with ignoring the rules - they lived in some weird town nobody never heard of  they didn't play power chords  they probably couldn't even spell 'spandex.' All they had was songs.;Rob Sheffield;power                    139,,,,,,,,,283
I would venture to guess that if I was a construction worker... who requested a transfer to another department for the betterment of his family  I would be commended for it. But because it's sports  there's just so much passion added to it.;Derek Fisher;sports                    143,,,,,,,,,283
I probably have the worst wardrobe. It's the most ill-fitting with the worst patterns and colors and the most nipple rubbage. There's bad chafing  and it's always tight in all the wrong places. What's sad is that I'm kinda getting used to it.;Josh Hopkins;sad                     145,,,,,,,,,283
I don't know what religious people do. I kind of wished I'd been a Christian with the blind faith that God is doing the right thing. As a Buddhist  you feel like you have more control over the situation  and that you can change your karma.;Marcia Wallace;faith                    146,,,,,,,,,283
People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the D.M.V. and look around  you're like  Oh  my God  I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers.;Marc Andreessen;computers                  151,,,,,,,,,283
Australia is so cool that it's hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food  great music  really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.;Mary-Kate Olsen;cool                    151,,,,,,,,,283

We all have the right of freedom of speech under the First Amendment. We all don't have to agree with one another on our opinions. Everyone in my circle  that I run around with  we all feel the same about God  country  integrity and character.;Luke Scott;freedom                  152,,,,,,,,,283
A just laicism allows religious freedom. The state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society  and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society.;Joseph Ratzinger;religion                     154,,,,,,,,,283
I've got tapes that I'm so thankful that my father made - old reel-to-reel tapes. I've got a ton of those things at home. He kept those like fine diamonds  I mean he kept them  you know  in a box and was very  very careful of them  you know.;Ricky Skaggs;thankful                 154,,,,,,,,,283
Life isn't meant to be easy. It's hard to take being on the top - or on the bottom. I guess I'm something of a fatalist. You have to have a sense of history  I think  to survive some of these things... Life is one crisis after another.;Richard M. Nixon;history                    156,,,,,,,,,283
There are characters in movies who I call 'film characters.' They don't exist in real life. They exist to play out a scenario. They can be in fantastic films  but they are not real characters what happens to them is not lifelike.;Philip Seymour Hoffman;movies                     157,,,,,,,,,283
My own dreams fortunately came true in this great state. I became Mr. Universe I became a successful businessman. And even though some people say I still speak with a slight accent  I have reached the top of the acting profession.;Arnold Schwarzenegger;dreams                     180,,,,,,,,,283
I think I am done with Wikipedia for the time being. But I have a secret hope. Someone recently proposed a Wikimorgue - a bin of broken dreams where all rejects could still be read  as long as they weren't libelous or otherwise illegal.;Nicholson Baker;dreams                     180,,,,,,,,,283
The beauty of a main title is that you establish your main theme and maybe a bit of your secondary theme. You plant the seed that you're going to go water later in the score. And so  having that removed just made it so much more difficult.;Danny Elfman;beauty                     181,,,,,,,,,283
I don't think any other city in the world... the sun doesn't shine the same way anywhere as it does in New York. And then I guess everyone's very good at hanging out. Not in a crazy way  but you're just constantly interacting and learning.;Ben Lovett;learning                     185,,,,,,,,,283
Over-commercialization and its resulting restrictions and limitations can be very damaging and distorting to the inherent nature of the individual. I did not deliberately abandon my fans  nor did I deliberately abandon any responsibilities.;Lauryn Hill;nature                     186,,,,,,,,,283
We're at the crossroads. Down one road is a European centralized bureaucratic socialist welfare system in which politicians and bureaucrats define the future. Down the other road is a proud  solid  reaffirmation of American exceptionalism.;Newt Gingrich;future                    189,,,,,,,,,283
Forgiveness is not a feeling - it's a decision we make because we want to do what's right before God. It's a quality decision that won't be easy and it may take time to get through the process  depending on the severity of the offense.;Joyce Meyer;forgiveness                     192,,,,,,,,,283
I feel like a lot of the female relationships I see on TV or in movies are in some way free of the kind of jealousy and anxiety and posturing that has been such a huge part of my female friendships  which I hope lessens a little bit with age.;Lena Dunham;hope                     197,,,,,,,,,283
It is no good getting furious if you get stuck. What I do is keep thinking about the problem but work on something else. Sometimes it is years before I see the way forward. In the case of information loss and black holes  it was 29 years.;Stephen Hawking;good                     220,,,,,,,,,283

To separate children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.;Earl Warren;age                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I do not come bearing a party label on my sleeve - or a quick fix in my back pocket. I do not come with a rigid ideology in my heart - or a soul that tells me to go it alone. I do not come to uproot tradition - or to be imprisoned by it.;Ted Kulongoski;alone                      258,,,,,,,,,283
The voice of the intelligence is drowned out by the roar of fear. It is ignored by the voice of desire. It is contradicted by the voice of shame. It is biased by hate and extinguished by anger. Most of all it is silenced by ignorance.;Karl A. Menninger;anger                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Rumors sound of galleries asking artists for upsized art and more of it. I've heard of photographers asked to print larger to increase the wall power and salability of their work. Everything winds up set to maximum in order to feed the beast.;Jerry Saltz;art                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I perfectly understood President Obama's attitude throughout the French presidential campaign. He had no reason to distance himself from Nicolas Sarkozy. It's the basic solidarity that leaders who worked together owe to each other.;Francois Hollande;attitude                      258,,,,,,,,,283
It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement the greatest source of visual beauty the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living.;David Attenborough;beauty                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Scientific research and other studies have demonstrated that arts education can enhance American students' math and language skills and improve test scores which in turn increase chances of higher education and good jobs in the future.;Thad Cochran;education                      258,,,,,,,,,283
My time at Shell was a most valuable experience because it taught me to look at the world in a long-term way. Shell takes a 20-year view on events and plans for different scenarios. It makes you see the world as a kind of large matrix.;Vince Cable;experience                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Meg Ryan is a beautiful and courageous woman. I grieve the loss of her companionship but I've not lost the friendship. We talk all the time and that was what our connection was about. She has a wonderful mind and we just like a chat.;Russell Crowe;friendship                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I have made a film about jazz that tries to look through jazz to see what it tells us about who we are as a people. I think that jazz is a spectacularly accurate model of democracy and a kind of look into our redemptive future possibilities.;Ken Burns;future                      258,,,,,,,,,283
We are losing sight of civility in government and politics. Debate and dialogue is taking a back seat to the politics of destruction and anger and control. Dogma has replaced thoughtful discussion between people of differing views.;James McGreevey;government                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.;Andy Warhol;home                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I knew I was a winner back in the late sixties. I knew I was destined for great things. People will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. I agree. Modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way - I hope it never will.;Arnold Schwarzenegger;hope                      258,,,,,,,,,283
The combination of landing the biggest interview of my career and having a drill in my back reminds me that God only gives us what we can handle and that it helps to have a good sense of humor when we run smack into the absurdity of life.;Robin Roberts;humor                      258,,,,,,,,,283
It's hard to decide how to match words to music. It's not like it's twice the work. It's always difficult for me to explain to the composer what I'm looking for. I'm not a professional I lack even basic knowledge about writing music.;Ayumi Hamasaki;knowledge                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I don't think there's any independent cartoonist whose stuff I don't like or respect in at least some way or another. We're all marginal laborers - we're practically medical oddities - so I don't see why we can't all be nice to each other.;Chris Ware;medical                      258,,,,,,,,,283
There are three reasons for becoming a writer: the first is that you need the money the second that you have something to say that you think the world should know the third is that you can't think what to do with the long winter evenings.;Quentin Crisp;money                      258,,,,,,,,,283
One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.;Dale Carnegie;nature                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too.;Frederick Buechner;peace                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I'm sickened by all religions. Religion has divided people. I don't think there's any difference between the pope wearing a large hat and parading around with a smoking purse and an African painting his face white and praying to a rock.;Howard Stern;religion                      258,,,,,,,,,283

When I was in Birmingham I used to go to a place called Redwood Field. I used to get there for a two o'clock game. Where can you make this kind of money playing sports? It was just a pleasure to go out and enjoy myself and get paid for it.;Willie Mays;sports                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Half of Google's revenue comes from selling text-based ads that are placed near search results and are related to the topic of the search. Another half of its revenues come from licensing its search technology to companies like Yahoo.;Eric Schmidt;technology                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Working on 'Gossip Girl' was a fantastic experience. It was my first real gig and I'm thankful for it - I got to learn a lot. I'm glad I got to explore getting comfortable in my own shoes in the background on a show like 'Gossip Girl.';Dreama Walker;thankful                      258,,,,,,,,,283
It is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes... we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions - especially selfish ones.;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn;truth                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on terrorism have reduced the pace of military transformation and have revealed our lack of preparation for defensive and stability operations. This Administration has overextended our military.;Barack Obama;war                      258,,,,,,,,,283
I'm excited about there being more of a sisterhood these days. Back in the '90s there was a lot of hate - the women I looked up to as artists were dissing me! It's not so patriarchal these days - there's more love and a lot less hate!;Alanis Morissette;women                      258,,,,,,,,,283
Feminism is a word that I identify with. The term has become synonymous with vitriolic man-hating but it needs to come back to a place where both men and women can embrace it. It is particularly important for women in developing countries.;Annie Lennox;women                      258,,,,,,,,,283
So  we just kind of created our own thing and that's part of the beauty of Athens: is that it's so off the map and there's no way you could ever be the East Village or an L.A. scene or a San Francisco scene  that it just became its own thing.;Michael Stipe;beauty                    2,,,,,,,,,284
No  what I should really like to do right now  in the full blaze of lights  before this illustrious assembly  is to shower every one of you with gifts  with flowers  with offerings of poetry - to be young once more  to ride on the crest of the wave.;Knut Hamsun;poetry               2,,,,,,,,,284
But  when we started our product portfolio  we focused the mixed signal requirements first for image processing devices and then in audio applications   targeting our technology into the growing use of digital technology in consumer markets.;David Milne;technology                   3,,,,,,,,,284
Shock  confusion  fear  anger  grief  and defiance. On Sept. 11 2001  and for the three days following the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil  President George W. Bush led with raw emotion that reflected the public's whipsawing stages of acceptance.;Ron Fournier;anger              5,,,,,,,,,284
To me  it all comes down to things being character-driven. It's hard for me to look beyond that. CG and all this cool stuff - so be it. But to me  it pretty much begins and ends with character-driven plots rather than technologically-driven plots.;Billy West;cool                    5,,,,,,,,,284
For me  every day is a new thing. I approach each project with a new insecurity  almost like the first project I ever did. And I get the sweats. I go in and start working  I'm not sure where I'm going. If I knew where I was going I wouldn't do it.;Frank Gehry;work                   6,,,,,,,,,284
Perhaps  to the uninformed  it may appear unaccountable that a man should be able to retain in his memory such a variety of learning but the close alliance with each other  of the different branches of science  will explain the difficulty.;Marcus V. Pollio;learning                  7,,,,,,,,,284
However  I wasn't very good at the sciences  or didn't have a lot of help in the sciences or something but certainly didn't set science for my A level. And when I came to take my A levels I didn't get a good enough result to go to University.;Jeremy Irons;science                    7,,,,,,,,,284
But hey  when you live in Watts  you need a little smack to get by  you know what I mean? You need something soft and comfortable in your life  'cause you're not going to get it from what's around you. And society isn't going to give it to you.;Jerry Garcia;society                  7,,,,,,,,,284
You know  we're each the hero of our own story and we perceive what's going on around us  and especially in a relationship  from the kind of viewpoint of  'Well  this is my story  and I'm the hero of that  and I justify what I do around it.';Michael Sheen;relationship               8,,,,,,,,,284
You know  I've carried a weapon for 10 years  never shot anybody  never robbed anybody. It has saved my life twice  but I know they're not toys. I practice with firearms  I enjoy shooting  it's a hobby of mine and I have a healthy respect for them.;Luke Scott;respect                8,,,,,,,,,284
That said  the question remains: how to strike the balance between free speech and mutual respect in this mixed-up world  both blessed and cursed with instant communication? We should not fight fire with fire  threats with threats.;Timothy Garton Ash;communication                   9,,,,,,,,,284
Above all  we must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living. On the other hand  to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage  in reality  does not help these people.;Joseph Ratzinger;respect                  9,,,,,,,,,284
Selfishness  narcissism  being uncomfortable in your own skin  not feeling connected to the world around you  feeling dislocated from family and youth  having a strange relationship with your childhood - all those things feel really true to me.;Jason Reitman;family                 11,,,,,,,,,284
And basically  the sense of the 'Pledge to America' is this: Republicans understand when we were in charge  we got fired in '06. We spent too much money. We defied the trust that the people had put in us. And we know that there is a better way.;Eric Cantor;trust                    13,,,,,,,,,284
Today in America  we are trying to prepare students for a high tech world of constant change  but we are doing so by putting them through a school system designed in the early 20th Century that has not seen substantial change in 30 years.;Janet Napolitano;change                    16,,,,,,,,,284
I was in college  and very disappointed. I majored in commercial art and interior design for three or four years. At that time  it seemed the thing I really wanted to do  production design  just wasn't available in the U.K.  so I turned to music.;Eric Burdon;design                 16,,,,,,,,,284
When I was working  and when I was making substantial amounts of money  I always filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped  when it was necessary to withdraw from society  in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family.;Lauryn Hill;family                  18,,,,,,,,,284
Truly fertile Music  the only kind that will move us  that we shall truly appreciate  will be a Music conducive to Dream  which banishes all reason and analysis. One must not wish first to understand and then to feel. Art does not tolerate Reason.;Albert Camus;art                  19,,,,,,,,,284
As a medical doctor  it is my duty to evaluate the situation with as much data as I can gather and as much expertise as I have and as much experience as I have to determine whether or not the wish of the patient is medically justified.;Jack Kevorkian;experience                     19,,,,,,,,,284
I am poor and naked  but I am the chief of the nation. We do not want riches but we do want to train our children right. Riches would do us no good. We could not take them with us to the other world. We do not want riches. We want peace and love.;Red Cloud;good                     19,,,,,,,,,284

I can remember when I was a baby and my mother was there watching the show. I went and bought 100 episodes and watched them.

I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can't help but be influenced by film.

One of the things that is not so good is that a decision was made long ago about the size of an IP address - 32 bits.

There are some good people. But a good chunk of them will lie for no reason at all - it'll be ten o'clock and they'll tell you it's nine.

The product of the artist has become less important than the fact of the artist. We wish to absorb this person. We wish to devour someone who has experienced the tragic.

Look  if you ask a child  'Would you rather have a fulfilled mother or a stay-at-home Sylvia Plath ' they'll pick Sylvia Plath every time.

I remember that. I was talking to him and I said how great it would be if actors had a tail because I have animals and a tail is so expressive. On a cat you can tell everything.

It's not just the 'Grammys' that I've pulled out of. I also pulled out of the English awards as well.

The state's interest in marriage is stability. Generally speaking  polygamy does not work for stability. Inherent in the whole polygamous movement is a deep and abiding misogyny and denigration of women. So polygamy is objectionable on lots of grounds.;Gene Robinson;marriage                     65,,,,,,,,,298

Washington is still very much a male-oriented culture. Being from Los Angeles  I think it is less so there - there is less attachment to tradition  perhaps  there is more flexibility  more acceptance of change generally.

Being a father at a later age is different from when I had my other two daughters when I was in my 20s and 30s.

You cannot trust 25 guys in a locker room to have the same respect and training as I do with a weapon. That I do understand. I've carried a gun for 10 years.

I think that giving mindless praise is ridiculous. But I understand why parents do it. They want their kids to feel good about themselves.

So many people prefer to live in drama because it's comfortable.

I don't believe war is a way to solve problems. I think it's wrong. I don't have respect for the people that made the decisions to go on with war. I don't have that much respect for Bush.

The threat today is not that of the 1930s. It's not big powers going to war with each other. The ravages which fundamentalist political ideology inflicted on the 20th century are memories.

My personal view is that such total planning by the state is an absolute good and not simply a relative good...

I think it's really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there. It's funny to me that we're expected to keep quiet just because of who we are.

The other is to look outside themselves to stimulate solutions.;Simon Mainwaring;trust                      276,,,,,,,,,301
No  writing musicals is the hardest thing in the world.

I still  at hotel rooms  I do this one sort of not-so-cool thing: continually shoving my room service tray in front of someone else's door. Because I don't want the remnants.

You know  at the end of the day  the only thing you have is trust and honor in this world. That's all you have. All you have is your reputation built on trust and your personal honor.

And to me  fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It's fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you  but it's not real. And it's totally not my approach to get my name on a club door just because I can.;Tom Felton;famous                    9,,,,,,,,,302
I live in  literally  the same home when I was swiping my first bank card and wondering if I'd have to put back the Charmin. We still don't have a dishwasher.

In America  now  let us - Christian  Jew  Muslim  agnostic  atheist  wiccan  whatever - fight nativism with the same strength and conviction that we fight terrorism.

In The Touch  the love scenes are the same as they were in The Thorn Birds or anything else I've ever written.

As a novelist  I mined my history  my family and my memory  but in a very specific way. Writing fiction  I never made use of experiences immediately as they happened.

I think violence  cynicism  brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet.

I was at a party  and some squiggly looking dude with a bow tie came up and said  'How'd you like to be on TV?' Turns out he was the programming guy at the Food Network.

I believe in God  but not as one thing  not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us.

We need to find God  and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence.

We need silence to be able to touch souls.;Mother Teresa;god                 19,,,,,,,,,302

By the time I was 30  nobody would work with me. I was friendless  I was hopeless  I was suicidal  lost my family - I mean  it was bad. Bottomed out  didn't know what I was going to do.

As far as luxury goes  about the only thing I do is... I go first class all the way.

In live action movies  you just hope that everything works. Because the actor may had a bad morning and doesn't play good  or accidents happen continuously.

Alcohol doesn't console  it doesn't fill up anyone's psychological gaps  all it replaces is the lack of God. It doesn't comfort man.

Another cause of change  one less noticeable but fundamental  is the modern growth of population closely connected with scientific and medical discoveries.

Fame does lead to money  which I don't have a close relationship with. I'm the kind of guy who never sees the money - it all goes somewhere else. I don't understand it  I don't like to deal with it. I have a fear of not having it  because I grew up without it.;David Duchovny;money                   23,,,,,,,,,302
If I don't need the money  I don't work. I'm going to spend time with my family and friends  and I'm going to travel and read and listen to music and try to learn a little bit more about how to be a human being  as opposed to learning how to be somebody else.;James Spader;learning                   25,,,,,,,,,302
I have got instincts that  I think  are very much in tune with people's very keen sense to see something different. I did not dream of being in politics since I was knee-high to a grasshopper.

My mother's incredibly giving  almost too giving at times. And  my dad is a real logical person. He's got logic for every situation.

My dad had a commercial film company  so he had a videotape player before anyone. So he got Mel Brooks movies or Citizen Kane or some classic old movies.

I think with motherhood and child-rearing in general  everyone's going to tell you how to do it and why.

As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one  so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself.;Arthur Schopenhauer;knowledge                     93,,,,,,,,,302

Sometimes a technology is so awe-inspiring that the imagination runs away with it - often far  far away from reality. Robots are like that. A lot of big and ultimately unfulfilled promises were made in robotics early on  based on preliminary successes.;Daniel H. Wilson;technology                    93,,,,,,,,,302
It seems the most logical thing in the world to believe that the natural resources of the Earth  upon which the race depends for food  clothing and shelter  should be owned collectively by the race instead of being the private property of a few social parasites.;Ralph Chaplin;food                   95,,,,,,,,,302

I don't think that fundamentalism has anything to do with Jesus Christ. They call themselves Christians  but if that's Christian  count me out. Fundamentalism is built on fear and greed.

Every day the eye is subject to a thousand tiny shocks as a thousand industries compete for the eye-kick  the visual hook that will lock the consumer into product for that crucial second where the tiny - or not so tiny - leap of the imagination is made.;Graham Joyce;imagination                     104,,,,,,,,,302
It's funny because 'The Book of Mormon' is 'The Book of Mormon' now. When I was doing it at the very beginning  and I was a part of it for four years and always believed in it  I never really knew if it was going to be more than a convention for 'South Park' fans.;Josh Gad;funny                    110,,,,,,,,,302
Our country was thereby saved from the consequences of its distracting individualistic conception of democracy  and its merely legal conception of nationality. It was because the followers of Jackson and Douglas did fight for it  that the Union was preserved.;Herbert Croly;legal                    110,,,,,,,,,302
I think that great poetry is the most interesting and complex use of the poet's language at that point in history  and so it's even more exciting when you read a poet like Yeats  almost 100 years old now  and you think that perhaps no one can really top that.;Diane Wakoski;poetry                   113,,,,,,,,,302
One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application  because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns  and that's what we love  and that's what we get off on.;Danica McKellar;art                   115,,,,,,,,,302

It's been a fascinating thing because we didn't really know how to write when we started South Park at all. It's been like  we've just sort of grown up a bit and it's amazing to just see how  if you take Butters and Cartman and put them in any scene  it works.;Trey Parker;amazing                   122,,,,,,,,,302
Growing up in northern California has had a big influence on my love and respect for the outdoors.

Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world. So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany  that does not mean that people were not in good spirits  or anything of that sort  but something much deeper and more important.;Ludwig Wittgenstein;humor                   124,,,,,,,,,302
The world we see that seems so insane is the result of a belief system that is not working.

I came to live in Shepperton in 1960. I thought: the future isn't in the metropolitan areas of London. I want to go out to the new suburbs  near the film studios.

A fact never went into partnership with a miracle. Truth scorns the assistance of wonders. A fact will fit every other fact in the universe  and that is how you can tell whether it is or is not a fact. A lie will not fit anything except another lie.;Robert Green Ingersoll;truth                     139,,,,,,,,,302

I have encouraged my kids to eat well from day one. I add flavor - herbs and spices - to everything because I don't want them getting used to starchy  bland food.

Everything seems fine until you're about 40. Then something is definitely beginning to go wrong.

I have spent a lifetime watching kids make mistakes because they were not trained or well led or properly motivated to do well.

There's a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you're self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left  you can veer off there  which isn't so easy in a car  and you can't cover as much ground walking.;David Byrne;car                   165,,,,,,,,,302

I remember the first time I saw the 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' video. I will never forget that day. I just wanted to see Kurt Cobain's face. I had a feeling he was very cute.

All I can hope to do is instill great morality in my son and trust him along the way. The music he listens to or how he chooses to wear his hair doesn't define his moral compass  and if he wants to listen to country music and wear a cowboy hat too  that's fine.;Mark Hoppus;trust                    177,,,,,,,,,302

Most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody else's expense. And I find that that's just a form of bullying in a major way.

I work too much to be an appropriate parent. I feel like a bad mom to my dog some days because I'm just not here enough.

I think I'm a bit less inhibited  and not thinking too much before speaking.

I don't read a lot of the sports  because I think people sometimes either build it up  or you have this guy that hates sports that is going to write bad about it  so I figure I'm not going to read it.

When you say 'fear of the unknown'  that is the definition of fear fear is the unknown  fear is what you do not know  and it's genetically within us so that we feel safe.

They are tools designed to gather spy-agency-like data in a seductive way  first and foremost  but as a side effect they tend to provide software support for mob-like phenomena.;Jaron Lanier;design                    156,,,,,,,,,303
If the president is failing to disclose material facts with regard to legislation being presented to the Congress on a question as important as war and peace  I think it does impair the level of trust that the House and the Senate have for this administration.;John Dingell;trust                     157,,,,,,,,,303
No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage.

It's surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves  and if you're not comfortable within yourself  you can't be comfortable with others.;Sydney J.

The strongest and most effective force in guaranteeing the long-term maintenance of power is not violence in all the forms deployed by the dominant to control the dominated  but consent in all the forms in which the dominated acquiesce in their own domination.;Robert Frost;power                     172,,,,,,,,,303
I think it's realistic to have hope. One can be a perverse idealist and say the easiest thing: 'I despair. The world's no good.' That's a perverse idealist. It's practical to hope  because the hope is for us to survive as a human species. That's very realistic.;Studs Terkel;hope                     179,,,,,,,,,303

One of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians. But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources  like artists  because art and music allow people a certain freedom.;Thom Yorke;music                    194,,,,,,,,,303
It's commonly said that people who've been ill in childhood and who've had an upset education never really regret that they do. It means that you don't look at the world in the way that other people do  and if you were inclined to be a writer  that's a help.;John Keegan;education                    201,,,,,,,,,303
I don't believe war is a way to solve problems. I think it's wrong. I don't have respect for the people that made the decisions to go on with war. I don't have that much respect for Bush.

And to me  fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It's fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you  but it's not real.

I think a lot of food shows  especially when we started 'Good Eats' back in the late '90s  they were still really about food. 'Good Eats' isn't about food  it's about entertainment.

It's just a way of trying to get to a third thing that's not particular to any quote-unquote genre. It's been great for me it's really opened me up and gotten me to use that part of my imagination.

I believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience  otherwise why go for it? I have to change me  and I have to learn things  and I have to push me and my limits.

It's not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living  but if you are going to eat out  do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas.

My husband cooks fancier food for himself than I've ever cooked on-air. I call him from the road  and he's making champagne-vanilla salmon or black-cherry pork chop. Half of me is feeling unworthy.

Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies. Women's magazines also often feature pictures of naked ladies.

One of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians. But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources  like artists  because art and music allow people a certain freedom.;Thom Yorke;freedom                    194,,,,,,,,,305
A desire arises in the mind. It is satisfied immediately another comes. In the interval which separates two desires a perfect calm reigns in the mind.

Arab leaders worry more about making money from the profits they get from oil and gas that they turn the other way when Lebanon is being destroyed right next to them.

I think Prince should open up a little more to other artists. Just because we love Prince. Especially the old stuff - we love him to death. But if he opened up he would be something to deal with.

You can't have bank holding companies acting as hedge funds. You can't have them taking a million-dollar pension plan for Joe Schmo the bus driver and treat it with the same risk appetite that you treat George Soros' pocket money.

It takes a lot of experience of life to see why some relationships last and others do not. But we do not have to wait for a crisis to get an idea of the future of a particular relationship.

Sometimes you trust someone who turns out not to be honest. There are a lot of things that happen in life that don't turn out the way you're given the impression that they will.

Look  I don't want to wax philosophic  but I will say that if you're alive you've got to flap your arms and legs  you've got to jump around a lot  for life is the very opposite of death  and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully  or you're not alive.;Mel Brooks;death                4,,,,,,,,,306

For me  growing up  the downside of it was that as a kid you don't want to stand out. You don't want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father  you know?

Clearly  some creative thinking is badly needed if humans are to have a future beyond Earth. Returning to the Moon may be worthy and attainable  but it fails to capture the public's imagination.

Honestly  I don't listen to nobody else's music but my own. It's kind of like sports to me. You don't see Kobe Bryant at a LeBron James game - he just works on his own game. And that's what I do.

As a whole  the managers today are different in temperament. Most have very good communication skills and are more understanding of the umpire's job. That doesn't mean they are better managers.

In Britain  you do your job. When you do an American TV show  there is a sense of being one with the crew  and there is a leadership element  which was a learning curve for me because it is very different culturally.

Don't ever  ever  believe anyone who tells you that you can just get by  by doing the easiest thing possible. Because there's always somebody behind you who really wants to do what you're doing.

I always say  I'm certain I changed 'Watchmen' less than the Coen brothers changed 'No Country for Old Men.' I'm certain of it. But you don't hear the Cormac McCarthy fans  like  up in arms about it.

Honest to God  all my life I have had such a fear of spiders. In fact  I use to have a reoccurring dream about one. Very clearly  it was black with a red head.

When you have kids  you instantly feel that you do not want to do them wrong.

My family was all born in Sicily and I'm Italian-American. They're the real thing.

One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application  because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form.

You always think that 70 is the end of the road: 'Somebody died when they were 73 good life'.

I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach  all my own age.

I'm not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing 'All the Way ' I was really thinking about my wife.

I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty.

The whole 'American Idol' way of looking at things is the antithesis of what I grew up with.

People ask 'do you make a conscious effort not to swear?' - if you're doing silly stuff you're not tempted to put swearing in. All the comics from my childhood  who were funny without swearing  were the people that influenced me. What I do is quite traditional anyway.;Tim Vine;funny                    159,,,,,,,,,306
I was a product of a divorced family and I used humor as a weapon to combat sadness.

There's a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you're self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left  you can veer off there  which isn't so easy in a car  and you can't cover as much ground walking.;David Byrne;freedom                   165,,,,,,,,,306

I'm so proud to represent the people of South Florida. I was so honored when President Obama asked me to serve as chair of the Democratic Party.

Political folk talk a lot these days about 'messaging' - a neologism designed to describe the way in which parties and politicians consciously characterize their efforts.

The most common error made in matters of appearance is the belief that one should disdain the superficial and let the true beauty of one's soul shine through.

Every single major push in education has made it worse and right now it's really bad because everything we've done is de-humanizing education.

Fear stifles our thinking and actions. It creates indecisiveness that results in stagnation. I have known talented people who procrastinate indefinitely rather than risk failure.

Death used to announce itself in the thick of life but now people drag on so long it sometimes seems that we are reaching the stage when we may have to announce ourselves to death.

Orlando's a really cool guy. They hired him for 'Lord of the Rings' out of drama school. He's very new at this still and doesn't have a lot of experience.

The claim made by Team Obama that every dollar in stimulus translates into a dollar-and-a-half in growth is economic fiction. The costs of stimulus reduce future growth.

For years my wedding ring has done its job. It has led me not into temptation. It has reminded my husband numerous times at parties that it's time to go home.

I've tried to reduce profanity but I reduced so much profanity when writing the book that I'm afraid not much could come out.

My favorite play in drama school was 'The Bacchae.' It's about a king who literally gets eaten alive by all the women in the play in a kind of orgy - it's related to the word 'bacchanal' - and I loved that idea of animalistic chaos and following our own desires.;Hugh Jackman;women                      281,,,,,,,,,306

She also provides comic relief.;Nikki Reed;relationship                     40,,,,,,,,,307
I love the man that can smile in trouble  that can gather strength from distress  and grow brave by reflection.

I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt  really. In the movies now  so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction  and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama there's no device  It's just about a human being.;Jack Nicholson;science                  41,,,,,,,,,307
Communication is a continual balancing act  juggling the conflicting needs for intimacy and independence. To survive in the world  we have to act in concert with others  but to survive as ourselves  rather than simply as cogs in a wheel  we have to act alone.;Deborah Tannen;communication                 42,,,,,,,,,307
If you just have a single problem to solve  then fine  go ahead and use a neural network. But if you want to do science and understand how to choose architectures  or how to go to a new problem  you have to understand what different architectures can and cannot do.;Marvin Minsky;science                  42,,,,,,,,,307
My inspiration was my mom. She's a great cook  and she still cooks  and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community  food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.;Emeril Lagasse;food                   45,,,,,,,,,307
What I'm concerned about is endless borrowing  which is going to compromise our economy not only today but in the future. Because we know the decisions we make right now really dramatically impact us in the future  and the debt is literally getting out of our control.;Paul Ryan;future                    45,,,,,,,,,307
'Not again!' I thought to myself this morning  as news trickled out that John McCain was set to pick Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Not again  because too often women are promoted for the wrong reasons  and then blamed when things don't go right.;Dee Dee Myers;morning                   45,,,,,,,,,307
I'm terrified of bugs and I travel with sprays  lotions  potions the lot. I have to check the room before I go to sleep and if I come across a bug and fail to remove it I have to sleep in a separate room as I'm paranoid that I'll be taken advantage of as I sleep.;Freema Agyeman;travel                    46,,,,,,,,,307
I suggest that the introductory courses in science  at all levels from grade school through college  be radically revised.

I don't know concretely if it's due to superstition  but any time a new rule is implemented into the NBA or a new piece of equipment or a new technology  there is always a transition and adjustment period by players and coaches and anyone involved with the game.;Stu Jackson;technology                    51,,,,,,,,,307
I used to eat because food tastes so good. I love food  it's one of the best things on this planet. But I changed the way I was thinking. I started asking myself  'Hey  am I eating because it tastes good? Or because I really need some more? Am I really still hungry?';Jordin Sparks;food                   54,,,,,,,,,307
I think that generally music should be a positive thing  I like Bob Marley's attitude: he said that his goal in life was to single handedly fight all the evil in the world with nothing but music  and when he went to a place he didn't go to play  he went to conquer.;Jon Fishman;attitude                   55,,,,,,,,,307
It's time for me to do things I like so I will be happy  my wife will be happy  my friends will be happy. I just want to do something I'm proud of. It's time for me to change.

The Internet creates as well as destroys. Social networks  search advertising  and cloud computing are multibillion dollar industries that didn't exist 10 years ago.

It is very easy to make clear what you want a film to say  but I did not wish to engage in overt propaganda  even for the right cause.

There is no greater feeling than hanging out with my dogs  or just walking around the land with our horses.

You might hold an ethical position that it's wrong to lie  but if you have plans for a war in Iraq  and you want to keep them secret for practical reasons - to reduce casualties  perhaps - and someone asks you about those plans  you may need to lie for a 'good' outcome.;Peter Singer;war                  57,,,,,,,,,307
As far as Saddam Hussein being a great military strategist  he is neither a strategist  nor is he schooled in the operational arts  nor is he a tactician  nor is he a general  nor is he a soldier. Other than that  he's a great military man  I want you to know that.;Norman Schwarzkopf;great               58,,,,,,,,,307
You have to have hope. It's irresponsible to give false hope  which I think a lot of playwrights are guilty of. But I also think it's irresponsible to simply be a nihilist  which quite a lot of playwrights  especially playwrights younger than me  have become guilty of.;Tony Kushner;hope                  60,,,,,,,,,307
So I had to be careful. I recognized the responsibility that  whether I liked it or not  I had to accept whatever the obligation was. That was to behave in a manner  to carry myself in such a professional way  as if there ever is a reflection  it's a positive one.;Sidney Poitier;positive                 60,,,,,,,,,307
To work in architecture you are so much involved with society  with politics  with bureaucrats. It's a very complicated process to do large projects.

I've got high standards when it comes to boys. As my dad says  all girls should! I'm from the South - Tennessee  to be exact - and down there  we're all about southern hospitality.

The main thing that gives me hope is the media. We have radio  TV  magazines  and books  so we have the possibility of learning from societies that are remote from us  like Somalia. We turn on the TV and see what blew up in Iraq or we see conditions in Afghanistan.;Jared Diamond;learning                 61,,,,,,,,,307
My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom  my dad  they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse  my dad was a school teacher.

I saw Deep Purple live once and I paid money for it and I thought  'Geez  this is ridiculous.' You just see through all that sort of stuff. I never liked those Deep Purples or those sort of things.

'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' is a good one because it not only turned out  I think  to be a really funny movie but it was also a delight to shoot.

It is generally recognised that women are better than men at languages  personal relations and multi-tasking  but less good at map-reading and spatial awareness.

I'm still shy - I'm no good at my children's parent-teacher conferences  and I'm slowly learning how to ask for what I want.

There's something that's sexy about a guy who has the strength to kill somebody  but is also vulnerable enough to be in love.

I don't really care what people tell children - when you believe in Santa Claus  the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy  one more fib won't hurt.

I was a mimic when I was a child. I mimicked the teacher and made friends that way  actually. That was a very subversive activity  because I was a goody-goody who never got in trouble.

I predict that in the future  scientists will learn how to convert stupidity into clean fuel.;Scott Adams;future                     199,,,,,,,,,307
Evolution is unobservable. It's based on blind faith in a few dry bones and on unreliable dating systems in which the gullible trust. Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about this issue  and not be censored to 'one side is all we will let you hear.';Ray Comfort;dating                     200,,,,,,,,,307
I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card. This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about. The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals  not the secrecy of government. We don't need a national ID card.;Ron Paul;society                     200,,,,,,,,,307
It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure.  Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure  to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.     Nathaniel S. Borenstein                     204,,,,,,,,,307
There's so much importance in honoring your everyday hero. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take connections. What matters is that people get involved.

I don't claim to be knowledgeable about theology. Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible.

Australians are coffee snobs. An influx of Italian immigrants after World War II ensured that - we probably had the word 'cappuccino' about 20 years before America.

Children themselves know they are being cheated. Ultimately we owe it to our children. They are in school for 190 days a year. Every moment they spend learning is precious.

Anyone can write a story based on the kind of horror where you see a guy in car and then there's the bad guy in the back seat. It's infantile to rely on that for telling a story. That's like going to bed and thinking there's a monster under your bed. It's silly.;Sergio Aragones;car                      282,,,,,,,,,307
The best advice my dad ever gave me is that acting is believing. Acting is not acting. It isn't putting on a face and dancing around in a mask. It's believing that you are that character and playing him as if it were a normal day in the life of that character.;Haley Joel Osment;dad                      282,,,,,,,,,307
We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us.

I think it's actually a misperception that I am a comedic actress. I do more drama than comedy but very little of it has been seen. When you are in big funny movies and they do well and your little part in it kind of explodes people perceive you as a comedian.;Octavia Spencer;funny                      282,,,,,,,,,307

It's very easy for me to say what success is. I think success is connecting with an audience who understands you and having a dialogue with them. I think success is continuing to push yourself forward creatively and not sort of becoming a caricature of yourself.;Lena Dunham;success                      282,,,,,,,,,307

Newspapers with declining circulations can complain all they want about their readers and even say they have no taste. But you will still go out of business over time.

For me  growing up  the downside of it was that as a kid you don't want to stand out. You don't want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father  you know? But I'm a product of nepotism. That's how I got my foot in the door  through my dad.;Jeff Bridges;alone                  6,,,,,,,,,308
I always  always meant to be on stage.

In Britain  you do your job. When you do an American TV show  there is a sense of being one with the crew  and there is a leadership element  which was a learning curve for me because it is very different culturally. In Britain  you just do it  leave and say  'Thanks.';Theo James;leadership               10,,,,,,,,,308
As a society  I think we express our cultural mores through our politics. We're trying constantly to figure out what's OK and what's not OK.

On 'Van Halen ' I was a young punk  and everything revolved around the fastest kid in town  gunslinger attitude.

People are funny  and in the most tragic situations  when comedy erupts from nowhere  it can turn on its head within the space of a second or a minute.

I decided at age 9  but I was reinforced at age 13 when a teacher told me I had talent. I can't say she really motivated me because I already knew. I knew I had talent.

And as a character  what I found very inspiring about playing Dharma  especially at that time  is that the women on television were more neurotic than they were free.

It's fun to have money  but the more money I get  the less interesting it becomes. If you don't have very much  you have to think about it. If you are starving  you become interested in food. If you are struggling to pay the bills  money becomes tragically important.;Sebastian Junger;food                 22,,,,,,,,,308
Happiness in this world  when it comes  comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit  and it leads us a wild-goose chase  and is never attained.

Especially with a comedy  you've got the clear cut goal of trying to make a scene funny. It's not like drama where you're trying to achieve some kind of emotion or trying to further the story along.

In the language of poetry  where every word is weighed  nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it.

Were I called on to define  very briefly  the term Art  I should call it 'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.'

I didn't want to be a writer  but I became one. And now I have many readers  in many countries. I think that's a miracle. So I think I have to be humble regarding this ability.

My family moved - first to Washington  D.C.  and then  in the spring of 1975  to Lebanon  where my father worked as a diplomat at the American embassy.

I think a responsibility comes with notoriety  but I never think of it as power. It's more like something you hold  like grains of sand.

Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well  it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes  say  Snoop Dogg.

Kids are a great analogy. You want your kids to grow up  and you don't want your kids to grow up.

What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced  it's that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can't wait too long. It's the single simplest measure to predict divorce.;Elizabeth Gilbert;amazing                     98,,,,,,,,,308
It is shallow people who think beauty is frivolous or excessive. If you are bringing beauty and god  you are enriching the country. Rice feeds the body  books feed the mind  beauty feeds the soul. It is one thing I can really be proud of and stand tall in the world.;Imelda Marcos;beauty                   99,,,,,,,,,308
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world  about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home?

There's a nastiness out there that wants to harm me with words. These are my enemies - the ideologues  the populists  the columnists who don't like the fact that I take them on toe-to-toe. What I try to do is tell the truth. It's not the coin of the realm in politics.;Ed Koch;politics                    101,,,,,,,,,308
We have a government that borrows $4 billion a day. We have a government that owes trillions of dollars in debt  half of that to foreigners  most of that to Chinese investors. I don't - that is extreme. Not only is it extreme. It's insane and it's unsustainable.;Marco Rubio;government                    111,,,,,,,,,308
It means a lot in my business and its a wonderful feeling to be recognized for what you have done over a lifetime  but I didn't go crazy.

The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and all of a sudden they've reached puberty  they believe that they like women. Actually  you're just horny.

Cosmologists have attempted to account for the day-to-day laws you find in textbooks in terms of fundamental 'superlaws ' but the superlaws themselves must still be accepted as brute facts. So maybe the ultimate laws of nature will always be off-limits to science.;Paul Davies;science                     119,,,,,,,,,308
My restaurants are never opened on Thanksgiving I want my staff to spend time with their family if they can. My feeling is  if I can't figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays  then I don't deserve to be an owner.;Michael Symon;family                    122,,,,,,,,,308
I stopped and gazed on the little dull man who was being paid to be a teacher of teachers. I turned and walked to the door  slammed it closed with a bang  and broken glass crashed to the floor.

In some movies you feel like you're a very small part of a huge machine. Whereas in the theater you can have a very small part  but you can still feel the weight and the gravity of it. Given the nature of theater  it's a more concentrated and quiet experience.;Minnie Driver;experience                    126,,,,,,,,,308

You find out in life that people really like you funny. So what do you give 'em? Humor. And then if you show them the other side  they don't like you as much.

In fact a lot of them I think are absolute baloney. Those Charles Olsens and people like that. At first I was interested in seeing what they were up to  what they were doing  why they were doing it.

To pursue a so-called Third Way is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work  and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed.;Vaclav Klaus;experience                     154,,,,,,,,,308
I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns  the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.;Angelina Jolie;women                     156,,,,,,,,,308

No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage.

What's funny is that the idea of popularity - even the use of the word 'popular' - is something that had been mostly absent from my life since junior high. In fact  the hallmark of life after junior high seemed to be the shedding of popularity as a central concern.;Susan Orlean;funny                     163,,,,,,,,,308

Pretty much at all times music motivates me. How can I say this without sounding in any way proud of myself? Obviously I've always written songs that are critical of our government  and talk about our times.

But it seems that the judging maybe they shouldn't at least see the practices all week long. That can taint the way they go into the judging and the outlook of what's going to happen  instead of just watching those four minutes and judging on those minutes alone.;Nancy Kerrigan;alone                     182,,,,,,,,,308
To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

I need to add that my work on multiple intelligences received a huge boost in 1995 when Daniel Goleman published his book on emotional intelligence. I am often confused with Dan.

We have a tremendous lack of knowledge of how far we have gotten away from the Constitution of the United States. Democrats and Republicans alike have taken us away from the original intent.

Who's to say that there is any more support for Freud's psychoanalytic concept of the superego than there is for that old time religion that asserted that there is a God who ordains what is right and wrong  and that His righteousness endures for all generations?;Tony Campolo;religion                     205,,,,,,,,,308
There's so much importance in honoring your everyday hero. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take connections. What matters is that people get involved.

I don't claim to be knowledgeable about theology. Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible.

Australians are coffee snobs. An influx of Italian immigrants after World War II ensured that - we probably had the word 'cappuccino' about 20 years before America.

There is no roles. No one is keeping any roles. The drummer is also answering everybody and everything.

The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity... and some scarce see nature at all.

I haven't been baptised. My dad's not in the church and is not a religious person. My mum is more spiritual - she does Thai-chi and goes to Stonehenge and things like that. I'm proud to be pagan.

You may not like the idea of putting money into a home when you're moving out. But it's demanded by the market. You need to show it off. You don't have to rip out the kitchen and bathroom.

Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children.

Back in 2004  Kellie Overbey handed me her play 'Girl Talk' to read. I fell in love with her brutally delicious humor and the fearlessly deft way in which she drew her characters.

And if sometimes things break or drop or the pasta hits the wall when I'm draining it  they never stop tape. They just kind of let me go with it.;Rachael Ray;food                  26,,,,,,,,,309
I think a lot of food shows  especially when we started 'Good Eats' back in the late '90s  they were still really about food. 'Good Eats' isn't about food  it's about entertainment. If  however  we can virally infect you with knowledge or interest  then all the better.;Alton Brown;knowledge                27,,,,,,,,,309
After I left the White House  I kept a foothold in the business of American politics as a talk-show host  analyst  commentator  speechmaker  and occasional writer. I was no longer a practitioner  but I was still a partisan  a Democrat  a blue-stater through and through.;Dee Dee Myers;business              28,,,,,,,,,309

When I think of myself at 15  even 17  I could simply not have done this work on an international level and travel all the time  take care of myself and not feel lost. I feel very happy that this is happening now  and not 10 years ago  as I feel stronger as a person.;Saskia de Brauw;travel                 28,,,,,,,,,309
When I am finishing a picture  I hold some God-made object up to it - a rock  a flower  the branch of a tree or my hand - as a final test. If the painting stands up beside a thing man cannot make  the painting is authentic. If there's a clash between the two  it's bad art.;Marc Chagall;art                 29,,,,,,,,,309
For the last 20 years of my life  I've had the mantra to do amazing parts with amazing people in amazing projects  so I'm attracted to good story  writing and character and good people. That's what I'm always searching for and I don't think that's ever going to change.;John Hawkes;change                   32,,,,,,,,,309
Where the stakes are the highest  in the war on terror  we cannot possibly succeed without extraordinary international cooperation. Effective international police actions require the highest degree of intelligence sharing  planning and collaborative enforcement.;Barack Obama;intelligence                   32,,,,,,,,,309
Women often postpone their lives  thinking that if they're not with a partner then it doesn't really count. They're still searching for their prince  in a way. And as much as we don't discuss that  because it's too embarrassing and too sad  I think it really does exist.;Jane Campion;women                  32,,,,,,,,,309
Remember the rights of the savage  as we call him. Remember that the happiness of his humble home  remember that the sanctity of life in the hill villages of Afghanistan  among the winter snows  is as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God  as can be your own.;William E. Gladstone;happiness                 33,,,,,,,,,309
Some say that I should settle down  go slower and not push so hard  so quickly for such transformational change. To them  I say that you misunderstand the size of the problems we face  the strength of the status quo and the urgency of the people's desire for change.;Eliot Spitzer;strength                  34,,,,,,,,,309
If my world were to cave in tomorrow  I would look back on all the pleasures  excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadness  not my miscarriages or my father leaving home  but the joy of everything else. It will have been enough.;Audrey Hepburn;sad                  36,,,,,,,,,309
Our theme for this year's festivities  Dreams and Challenges of Asian Pacific Americans  speaks to the many generations of Asian Pacific Americans who worked hard to overcome economic hardship  racism and other barriers in their pursuit of the American dream.;Lucille Roybal-Allard;dreams                   37,,,,,,,,,309
My knee is as strong as it was before  if not stronger  and it's a matter of getting my leg strong. I lost six years of strength in about six month's time  so it's going to take another year or two to get that leg back up to full strength  but I'm good to go so far.;Picabo Street;strength                  37,,,,,,,,,309
I grew up on the crime stuff. Spillane  Chandler  Jim Thompson  and noir movies like Fuller  Orson Welles  Fritz Lang. When I first showed up in New York to write comics back in the late 1970s  I came with a bunch of crime stories but everybody just wanted men in tights.;Frank Miller;movies                38,,,,,,,,,309
I have a crazy amount of different jobs  so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips  they would do something called swapping  where they would fill the memory with one task  do it and get it out.;Louis C.

Now that I finally have the time for it  this web surfing stuff turns out to be as interesting and fun and addictive as you've all been telling me. Zipping from link to link  chasing an idea across the noosphere  sucking up information like a killer whale - way cool.;Spider Robinson;cool                   39,,,,,,,,,309
You must accept that you might fail then  if you do your best and still don't win  at least you can be satisfied that you've tried. If you don't accept failure as a possibility  you don't set high goals  you don't branch out  you don't try - you don't take the risk.;Rosalynn Carter;failure                 40,,,,,,,,,309
I think I'm a very good reader of poetry  but obviously  like everybody  I have a set of criteria for reading poems  and I'm not shy about presenting them  so if people ask for my critical response to a poem  I tell them what works and why  and what doesn't work and why.;Diane Wakoski;poetry               40,,,,,,,,,309
I think that anybody that stays in school  gets good grades  pays the price  I think we are wealthy enough in the public and the private sector in America to make sure that every child in America that wants to continue their education  they should be able to do that.;J.

We call that person who has lost his father  an orphan and a widower that man who has lost his wife. But that man who has known the immense unhappiness of losing a friend  by what name do we call him? Here every language is silent and holds its peace in impotence.;Joseph Roux;friendship                    43,,,,,,,,,309
My inspiration was my mom. She's a great cook  and she still cooks  and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community  food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.;Emeril Lagasse;family                   45,,,,,,,,,309
While I have felt lonely many times in my life  the oddest feeling of all was after my mother  Lucille  died. My father had already died  but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely  yet I did.;Bill Murray;family                 46,,,,,,,,,309
The three main sources of scepticism are first  that not every people desires freedom second  that democracy in certain parts of the world would be dangerous and third  that there is little the world's democracies can do to advance freedom outside their countries.;Natan Sharansky;freedom                   46,,,,,,,,,309
In an age of social media and content being key  it's important to change the mold where you have $100 000 to $150 000 for one video. I hired some guys that are young  just out of college  and we used some new  far-less-expensive cameras and technology to make videos.;Ronnie Dunn;technology                47,,,,,,,,,309
I have a Viking stove. The color is butter lemon  and I had to wait several months for it  because that color wasn't available and I really wanted butter lemon! But I don't know that it's seriously ever been cooked on. I mean  I make tea every morning. Does that count?;Andy Cohen;morning                   48,,,,,,,,,309
I remember opening my dad's closet and there were  like  40 suits  every color of the rainbow  plaid and winter and summer. He had two jewelry boxes full of watches and lighters and cuff links. And just... he was that guy. He was probably unfulfilled in his life in many ways.;Jon Hamm;dad                  49,,,,,,,,,309
Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well  it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes  say  Snoop Dogg. It's hard to say  'That guy is less than you.' The kid is like  'I like that guy  he's cool. How is he less than me?;Jay-Z;music                52,,,,,,,,,309
Every time you get on a stage or in front of a camera  the whole exercise is about imagination. You're constantly depicting something that doesn't exist  and trying to find the reality of it. Once you settle on that premise  everything else is a matter of degrees.;Ron Perlman;imagination                   53,,,,,,,,,309
Have you ever watched someone become American? Last week  at a national citizenship conference I organize  thirty immigrants from 17 countries swore an oath and became citizens of the United States. It was a stirring experience for the hundreds of people in the room.;Eric Liu;experience                    56,,,,,,,,,309
We need the help of other member countries and leaders who  like us  want to see a change in Europe's direction. That's also my logic when I tell voters that electing me president will not only shape France's future  but also initiate change across all of Europe.;Francois Hollande;future                   58,,,,,,,,,309
I'll tell you what I really enjoy. We all go to the movies  we all watch television  we know what they're about  how they work. When the main character is a cop or a spy  it's very exciting  but I also very much enjoy when the main characters are nobodies - a trucker.;Nathan Fillion;movies                 58,,,,,,,,,309
With millions of family wage manufacturing jobs lost since 2001  we need an energy bill that takes bold action to tap into American ingenuity in order to lead the world in new clean energy technology  rather than playing catch-up to the Japanese  Danish  and Germans.;Jay Inslee;technology                  63,,,,,,,,,309
If I can procure three hundred good substantial names of persons  or bodies  or institutions  I cannot fail to do well for my family  although I must abandon my life to its success  and undergo many sad perplexities and perhaps never see again my own beloved America.;John James Audubon;sad                 64,,,,,,,,,309
There were all us baby boomers who had a grammar school education  started to learn  then went on the pill  the whole thing  and so there are today a lot more women writers  editors  producers  and so a lot more women's stories.

Real shapes and real patterns are things you would observe in nature  like the marks on the back of a cobra's hood or the markings on a fish or a lizard. Imaginary shapes are just that  symbols that come to a person in dreams or reveries and are charged with meaning.;Jim Woodring;dreams                    68,,,,,,,,,309
There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man  beyond history  and beyond science. The moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit.;Ansel Adams;nature                    69,,,,,,,,,309
It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure  to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting  for in movement there is life  and in change there is power.;Alan Cohen;power                   70,,,,,,,,,309
We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts  foreign ideas  alien philosophies  and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.;John F. Kennedy;truth                   70,,,,,,,,,309
My mother encouraged it so much. She was so supportive. Even if as a kid  I would do the dumbest trick  which now that I look back on some things  she would love it  she would say that's amazing  or if I'd make the ugliest drawing  she would hang it up. She was amazing.;David Blaine;amazing                72,,,,,,,,,309
There's so many things I want to do. I want to work with great filmmakers  great actors  great scripts. And there's no reason for me to do anything short of that  because I'm 24  I don't have a family  I don't need to make tons of money  and I'm not dying to get famous.;Tobey Maguire;famous                73,,,,,,,,,309

Try to make at least one person happy every day. If you cannot do a kind deed  speak a kind word. If you cannot speak a kind word  think a kind thought.

Individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives  who seem to welcome them to the next world. These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.;Stanislav Grof;experience                     83,,,,,,,,,309
I have come close to producing films. But generally by the time they hit the screen  there's about 50 people with producer credits  so what's the point. I usually find scripts I like with no money attached and take them to producers that I know and try to raise finance.;Tim Roth;finance                    83,,,,,,,,,309
Non-disclosure in the Internet Age is quickly perceived as a breach of trust.

There are two kinds of artists in this world those that work because the spirit is in them  and they cannot be silent if they would  and those that speak from a conscientious desire to make apparent to others the beauty that has awakened their own admiration.;Anna Katharine Green;beauty                    90,,,,,,,,,309
To give money to a woman - and here I must speak as a man - is to deny her special quality  her irreplaceability  and reduce her unique amiability to a commodity. Money takes away her name  while transforming her lover into a nameless customer of a market of appetites.;James Buchan;money                   90,,,,,,,,,309
Just what future the Designer of the universe has provided for the souls of men I do not know  I cannot prove.

All the information you could want is constantly streaming at you like a runaway truck - books  newspaper stories  Web sites  apps  how-to videos  this article you're reading  even entire magazines devoted to single subjects like charcuterie or wedding cakes or pickles.;Mario Batali;wedding                94,,,,,,,,,309
I sort of always had an inkling towards some kind of an art form. I grew up in a very small town  and I just figure-skated. My dad played hockey and I was surrounded by sports  but it wasn't quite doing it for me. I wasn't totally fulfilled  and I did a lot of skating.;Rachel McAdams;dad                   96,,,,,,,,,309
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world  about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?;James Hillman;home                     99,,,,,,,,,309
The wit makes fun of other persons the satirist makes fun of the world the humorist makes fun of himself  but in so doing  he identifies himself with people - that is  people everywhere  not for the purpose of taking them apart  but simply revealing their true nature.;James Thurber;nature                 104,,,,,,,,,309
We are taught to consume. And that's what we do. But if we realized that there really is no reason to consume  that it's just a mind set  that it's just an addiction  then we wouldn't be out there stepping on people's hands climbing the corporate ladder of success.;River Phoenix;success                   109,,,,,,,,,309
We associate the North Atlantic with cod. The motto of Newfoundland used to be 'In cod we trust.' It was a joke  but it was essentially true. But there is no cod anymore. And that's extraordinary. It's all because of either greed or politics - Canadian politics.;Simon Winchester;trust                     111,,,,,,,,,309
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease  love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other  or assumes that the greater the love  the greater the jealousy.;Robert A. Heinlein;jealousy                   113,,,,,,,,,309
Every friend of freedom must be as revolted as I am by the prospect of turning the United States into an armed camp  by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence.;Milton Friedman;freedom                     115,,,,,,,,,309
I hope we never get to the point that we put ourselves in Jesus' place. But when I read the New Testament basically  we get three mandates: to love God  to love each other  and to take care of the least among us. And I think this is at least a step in the right direction.;Bob Riley;hope                   115,,,,,,,,,309
I think these movies are as much for people of that time as for people who weren't born. For people who weren't born  they see how leaders must act under a crisis situation  not trying to be re-elected or not trying to check polls  that they go from their gut check.;Kevin Costner;movies                   116,,,,,,,,,309
I like to edit my sentences as I write them. I rearrange a sentence many times before moving on to the next one.

You have to respect your parents. They are giving you an at-bat. If you're an entrepreneur and go into the family business  you want to grow fast. Patience is important.

L.A.'s cool I had a run with it to where it just pretty much wore me out. I love the weather and I have great friends there  great family  but I really cannot take a lot of the culture.

I have come to understand and appreciate writers much more recently since I started working on a book last fall.

You want to try and bring a character to life in an honest a way as you possibly can. It doesn't matter whether he's a doctor  an actor  a car salesman or a captain of a starship.

A line from one of my 1997 columns - 'Do one thing every day that scares you' - is now widely attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt  though I have yet to see any evidence that she ever said it and I don't believe she did.

We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases  while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history  the stage of rule by brute force.;Ayn Rand;government                    125,,,,,,,,,309
Happiness does not come from football awards. It's terrible to correlate happiness with football. Happiness comes from a good job  being able to feed your wife and kids.

It has now been over 7 years since Congress last raised the minimum wage to its current level of $5.15 per hour. Since that last increase  Congress's failure to adjust the wage for inflation has reduced the purchasing power of the minimum wage to record low levels.;Jon Corzine;failure                     137,,,,,,,,,309
I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty. We encourage you to be neat  obedient  loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words  which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics.;Newt Gingrich;politics                   137,,,,,,,,,309
Jews know this in their bones. Our community could not exist for a day without its volunteers.

Both dreams and myths are important communications from ourselves to ourselves. If we do not understand the language in which they are written  we miss a great deal of what we know and tell ourselves in those hours when we are not busy manipulating the outside world.;Erich Fromm;great                     142,,,,,,,,,309
I just feel like with independent movies... they're really free to do whatever they want. They're not afraid to make a statement about anything  and there's not a huge studio behind them making sure that everything is wholesome and politically correct and all that.;Emma Roberts;movies                     143,,,,,,,,,309
If women are supposed to be less rational and more emotional at the beginning of our menstrual cycle when the female hormone is at its lowest level  then why isn't it logical to say that  in those few days  women behave the most like the way men behave all month long?;Gloria Steinem;men                   147,,,,,,,,,309
Research shows that children do better in school and are less likely to drop out when fathers are involved. Engaged parents can strengthen communities  mentor and tutor students  and demonstrate through their actions how much they value their children's education.;Arne Duncan;education                    150,,,,,,,,,309
I think the success of democracy is not really police security it's the presence of a broad middle class. The stronger the middle class of a people is  the less you have to worry about one group coming in and exploiting the democratic process for its own ends.;King Abdullah II;success                     150,,,,,,,,,309
It is because I believe that it is in the power of such nations to lead the world back into the paths of peace that I propose to devote myself to explaining what  in my opinion  can and should be done to banish the fear of war that hangs so heavily over the world.;Arthur Henderson;fear                    161,,,,,,,,,309
I will say that the idea of a woman being deceptive came from that original discussion with critics and reporters about if woman could do that kind of thing. Evelyn  herself  grew out of the discussions about how capable women are of deceit and lying and manipulation.;Neil LaBute;women                    164,,,,,,,,,309
We have domesticated God's transcendence. We often learn about God at about the same time as we are learning about Santa Claus but our ideas about Santa Claus change  mature and become more nuanced  whereas our ideas of God can remain at a rather infantile level.;Karen Armstrong;change                    165,,,,,,,,,309
I think it's child abuse to have someone in the public eye too young. Society basically values wealth and fame and power at the cost of well-being. In the case of a child  it's at the cost of someone's natural development. It's already hard enough to develop.;Alanis Morissette;society                     170,,,,,,,,,309
America's fighting men and women sacrifice much to ensure that our great nation stays free. We owe a debt of gratitude to the soldiers that have paid the ultimate price for this cause  as well as for those who are blessed enough to return from the battlefield unscathed.;Allen Boyd;men                     183,,,,,,,,,309
It's amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations. One of the first things the young composers who come to work with me say is that they want to write music people will like  instead of gaining their credentials by being rejected by the audience.;Carlisle Floyd;amazing                     189,,,,,,,,,309
My dad taught me to play bass. He's a bass player he still plays in a band in Michigan to this day. He taught me to play bass when I was about 6.

After I had success it was great  at first  not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.;Leonardo DiCaprio;history                  67,,,,,,,,,310
Whether it's viewers of the show or readers of my columns and books  I'm consistently impressed with their wit  humor and insight. That goes for about 95 percent of the audience. The other five percent are why the 'Delete' option and restraining orders were invented.;Richard Roeper;humor                    67,,,,,,,,,310

My faith is very private to me. It plays an important part in my life  but I do not try and throw my beliefs at others. I have tremendous respect for all faiths and beliefs  but have a deep concern that religion and faith are currently a long way apart from each other.;Rick Wakeman;faith                    69,,,,,,,,,310
There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man  beyond history  and beyond science.

It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure  to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting  for in movement there is life  and in change there is power.;Alan Cohen;change                   70,,,,,,,,,310
My niece was very much caught up in the vampire craze for young adults  and she thought having a vampire boyfriend would be a cool thing. What do you do on a first date? The more I thought about it  the more fun I had imagining what you'd serve a vampire for dinner.;Deborah Harkness;cool                    70,,,,,,,,,310
But if I can be convinced and then through the work that we do together  the orchestra can really be convinced of the big sweep of that communication that the piece suggests  then the audience will get it and it will be a good experience for all of us.;Michael Tilson Thomas;communication                    71,,,,,,,,,310
All observers not laboring under hallucinations of the senses are agreed  or can be made to agree  about facts of sensible experience  through evidence toward which the intellect is merely passive  and over which the individual will and character have no control.;Chauncey Wright;experience                  72,,,,,,,,,310
You could write a song about some kind of emotional problem you are having  but it would not be a good song  in my eyes  until it went through a period of sensitivity to a moment of clarity. Without that moment of clarity to contribute to the song  it's just complaining.;Joni Mitchell;good                  74,,,,,,,,,310
We are at a crossroads in the music business: with the rise of the internet  the world we live in has changed  and the past is not coming back. But I see the glass as half-full: the internet and social networking are new avenues for the next Bob Dylan to be born on.;Jon Bon Jovi;business                    75,,,,,,,,,310
This is not a zero-sum game. We know that if we provide access and education  particularly where there are gaps in the market  we will create more jobs  we will create more growth  and we will create more activity in the U.S. market  which will be good for our economy.;Karen Mills;education                 76,,,,,,,,,310

The British political system and the whole clapped out Westminster architecture  and the language that we use about politics  it's completely unsustainable.

These days I travel so much it's hard to get into a routine. When I'm on the road  I tend to use hotel gyms. When I'm home in L.A.  I like to hike and hit the surf. All in all  I try to keep a balanced diet and exercise routine  which has stood me in good stead to date.;Curtis Stone;travel                  81,,,,,,,,,310

The only reason to be in politics is public service. There's no other reason. Frankly  if that's the best job you can get in terms of money  that's too bad  you know. Because frankly  it's not well paid  everyone knows that. So for most people it's a big sacrifice.;Malcolm Turnbull;politics                 85,,,,,,,,,310
Humans have a fraught relationship with beasts. They are our companions and our chattel  our family members and our laborers  our household pets and our household pests.

I'm not driven to get back into politics. It's not on my top five things to do before I die  but saying that  I may be in politics in the next year or the next ten years. I've been on the front line for 12 years  four in state government  eight on the national level.;J. C. Watts;government                  91,,,,,,,,,310
A lot of film directors are quite scared of actors. They are a bit of a nightmare sometimes  but I like them. It looks like cunning  but you try to get extra things from them all the time  by stealth  by making them feel confident  so they trust you and you can push a bit.;Danny Boyle;trust                 91,,,,,,,,,310

I'm a jewelry girl. I became with friends with designer Irene Neuwirth a few years ago. At that point  I just used to wear my wedding rings. Very low key.

There's something about music that encourages people to want to know more about the person that made it  and where it was recorded  what year it was done  what they were listening to  and all this kind of stuff. There's something that invites all this obsessive behavior.;David Byrne;music                  103,,,,,,,,,310

Some go into the arts  some are craftsmen  some take a little time out to travel  and some start their own businesses.

Now I'm a wife and a mother of two. It's a really different role. I always referred to No Doubt as a marriage  because that's what it's like to be together for so long and go through what we've been through. I can't really have that relationship with them anymore.;Gwen Stefani;marriage                     109,,,,,,,,,310
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease  love is a healthy condition.

I know that some endeavor to throw the mantle of romance over the subject and treat woman like some ideal existence  not liable to the ills of life.

I had the experience last year of directing my first feature while I had a 1-year-old son and while I was also pregnant  so I am now well aware of the difficulties women who are rearing children face when they're also trying to make headway in mainstream of film.;Diablo Cody;experience                     119,,,,,,,,,310
Too many Christians have a commitment of convenience. They'll stay faithful as long as it's safe and doesn't involve risk  rejection  or criticism. Instead of standing alone in the face of challenge or temptation  they check to see which way their friends are going.;Charles Stanley;alone                   121,,,,,,,,,310
It was a real surprise to me to come across the evidence that Christianity might once have been a danced religion. Certainly  some of the early church leaders thought this was great and spoke of what seems to have been circle dancing  perhaps around an altar.;Barbara Ehrenreich;religion                    124,,,,,,,,,310
I've used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible.

All science requires mathematics. The knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us. This is the easiest of sciences  a fact which is obvious in that no one's brain rejects it for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon.;Roger Bacon;knowledge                     126,,,,,,,,,310
Ask everyone whether they're an actor or a doctor or a teacher or whatever is entitled to his or her opinion. But unfortunately  because actors are in the public eye  whether we want it or not  sometimes our opinions carry more weight or influence than they deserve.;Debra Messing;teacher                   127,,,,,,,,,310
There are some people who become best friends with everyone they photograph. There are people that I really like and admire and respect  but in a way I think it's better to keep a distance.

Life certainly points it out to you - 'you can go this way or the other way.'

Both dreams and myths are important communications from ourselves to ourselves.

My friendships and relationships in the conservative world are not predicated on political correctness and enforced conformity of thought. They are based  instead  on mutual respect  honesty and understanding - concepts many modern liberals should consider revisiting.;Tammy Bruce;respect                   153,,,,,,,,,310
Yet it looks as if the thing we use to solve our problems with is the source of our problems. It's like going to the doctor and having him make you ill. In fact  in 20% of medical cases we do apparently have that going on. But in the case of thought  its far over 20%.;David Bohm;medical                    160,,,,,,,,,310
It is because I believe that it is in the power of such nations to lead the world back into the paths of peace that I propose to devote myself to explaining what  in my opinion  can and should be done to banish the fear of war that hangs so heavily over the world.;Arthur Henderson;peace                    161,,,,,,,,,310
We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while  but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.;Carl Sagan;technology                     161,,,,,,,,,310
The number one mistake is giving pets table scraps. I made the mistake thinking I was showing my dog love by giving her food and treats. You see a tiny 4 oz. piece of cheese  but for a Boston Terrier like mine  that's like one and a half hamburgers. That's unhealthy.;Alison Sweeney;food                    173,,,,,,,,,310
That free will was demonstrated in the placing of temptation before man with the command not to eat of the fruit of the tree which would give him a knowledge of good and evil  with the disturbing moral conflict to which that awareness would give rise.;Kenneth Scott Latourette;knowledge                     174,,,,,,,,,310

A man can be drawn across the room with the simplicity of a smile. That's why your pearly whites should always be straight and shiny. I think most of my clients are drawn to a fun  flirty nature in a woman. The problem is  most women do not often feel fun and flirty.;Patti Stanger;smile                    179,,,,,,,,,310
Truth is the silliest thing under the sun. Try to get a living by the Truth and go to the Soup Societies. Heavens!

They also try to deal with counselling  stolen generations issues  family relationships  violence  suicide prevention.;Malcolm Fraser;health                  187,,,,,,,,,310
I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card. This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about. The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals  not the secrecy of government. We don't need a national ID card.;Ron Paul;government                     200,,,,,,,,,310

Everyone takes pause at 40. It's the age you have to assess everything in your life. It's the fictitious marker that's always coming up when you're young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40  and be successful by 40. Whatever success means.;Paul Feig;age                     222,,,,,,,,,310
The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What's amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change  but our view of beauty stays the same.;Hugh Hefner;beauty                     227,,,,,,,,,310
Newspapers with declining circulations can complain all they want about their readers and even say they have no taste. But you will still go out of business over time.

I am totally fascinated by people and our history as I understand and continue to explore it. People have so much to give and so far to go and yet we have given and gone a great distance.

The peculiar fascination which the South held over my imagination and my limited capital decided me in favor of Atlanta University so about the last of September I bade farewell to the friends and scenes of my boyhood and boarded a train for the South.;James Weldon Johnson;imagination                      285,,,,,,,,,310
For years my wedding ring has done its job. It has led me not into temptation. It has reminded my husband numerous times at parties that it's time to go home. It has been a source of relief to a dinner companion. It has been a status symbol in the maternity ward.;Erma Bombeck;marriage                      285,,,,,,,,,310
I got married at 22 and remained in an abusive marriage for 10 years. I made up my mind that that was never going to happen to me again. I made a brave step to walk out in a society when you didn't walk out of an abusive marriage. It was mental and physical abuse.;Joyce Banda;marriage                      285,,,,,,,,,310
The real cure for our environmental problems is to understand that our job is to salvage Mother Nature. We are facing a formidable enemy in this field. It is the hunters... and to convince them to leave their guns on the wall is going to be very difficult.;Jacques Yves Cousteau;nature                      285,,,,,,,,,310
We have to unclutter our brains from worries that maybe people don't like us. Women tend to worry about popularity it doesn't matter if they like you. They need to respect you. They need to show that respect for you in your pay check. And that needs to be okay.;Mika Brzezinski;respect                      285,,,,,,,,,310
I think the thing's that perhaps sad really is that younger people haven't come in and I think it must have been absolutely fantastic to have worked in the 50's when you had all of the great Broadway composers and when West Side Story didn't win the Tony Award.;Andrew Lloyd Webber;sad                      285,,,,,,,,,310
A time will come when a politician who has willfully made war and promoted international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the noose than a private homicide.

Well  it is so difficult right now when you look out on the road and how fast people go and the more and more cars you see out there  for teenagers  you'd think a kid that literally  a few years before  was sitting back in a car seat in the back seat is now behind the wheel.;Amy Klobuchar;car                 4,,,,,,,,,311
Well  we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies.

And so  at the age of thirty  I had successively disgraced myself with three fine institutions  each of which had made me free of its full and rich resources  had trained me with skill and patience  and had shown me nothing but forbearance and charity when I failed in trust.;Simon Raven;trust                 6,,,,,,,,,311
You know  the interesting thing about having traveled around the country as much as I have  and I think it's sort of inadvertently what made me come out or at least begin doing things within the community and thinking more about that  was that I get to travel quite a bit.;Lesley Gore;travel                   8,,,,,,,,,311
Well look  CIA is an agency that has to collect intelligence  do operations. We have to take risks and it's important that we take risks and that we know that we have the support of the government and we have the support of the American people in what we're doing.;Leon Panetta;intelligence                    9,,,,,,,,,311
In Britain  by contrast  we still think that class plays a part in determining a person's life chances  so we're less inclined to celebrate success and less inclined to condemn failure. The upshot is that it's much easier to be a failure in Britain than it is in America.;Toby Young;failure                   10,,,,,,,,,311
As a society  I think we express our cultural mores through our politics. We're trying constantly to figure out what's OK and what's not OK. And it's hard  because our society is constantly buffeted by gale force winds of technology. Things are always changing.;Daniel H. Wilson;technology                    12,,,,,,,,,311
When I was 14  I felt very rundown I had a home to go to  but I felt like I was 60 or something  older than I feel now.

It's so amazing  standing on the corner -this happened in Washington  D.C. - and somebody comes by in a Cadillac and you hear 'Manic Monday' on the radio  and you don't even know this person  and they're listening to it and singing along with it.

For everything I do  I think about a 6-year-old girl and her mom that I saw at my concert last night. I think about what those two individuals would think if I were at a club last night.

Competitiveness is really what it costs you per man-hour to get you what you want.

He should have been somebody who had a backpack  an old map  a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world.;Christian Bale;family                  75,,,,,,,,,312
We created a line of pet food called Nutrish that's made to human standards  and 100 percent of the proceeds go to animal rescue. One of our top-tier donors is the ASPCA  and they help us challenge animal shelters all across the country to get more animals placed in homes.;Rachael Ray;food                    75,,,,,,,,,312
You watch an old 'Jeopardy!' and the categories alone are very plain. 'Poetry ' or 'Movies ' or 'Physics.' If you watch it now  though  there'll be a theme board where the categories are all Hitchcock movies. Lots more jokes  lots more high-concept categories and questions.;Ken Jennings;alone                 77,,,,,,,,,312
Rwanda was considered a second-class operation because it was a small country  we had been able to maintain a kind of status quo. They were negotiating  they'd accepted the new peace project  so we were under the impression that everything would be solved easily.;Boutros Boutros-Ghali;peace                   77,,,,,,,,,312
All women have a perception much more developed than men. So all women somehow  being repressed for so many millennia  they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love. And this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society.;Paulo Coelho;love                    78,,,,,,,,,312

A teacher is never too smart to learn from his pupils. But while runners differ  basic principles never change. So it's a matter of fitting your current practices to fit the event and the individual.

I was attending the University of Alberta. I was going to be a high school teacher  like my parents. I failed - no  I didn't fail a class  I just barely passed. I really didn't try. It was Canadian history  through the plays of the time. My God  those were boring plays.;Nathan Fillion;teacher                 82,,,,,,,,,312
Study after study confirms that even when you control for variables like profession  education  hours worked  age  marital status  and children  men still are compensated substantially more - even in professions  like nursing  dominated by women. No wonder there's a gender gap.;Dee Dee Myers;age              83,,,,,,,,,312
Such discussions help us very little to enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry  to discriminate between what is more and what is less excellent in them  or to use words like beauty  excellence  art  poetry  with a more precise meaning than they would otherwise have.;Walter Pater;beauty                86,,,,,,,,,312

The spiral in a snail's shell is the same mathematically as the spiral in the Milky Way galaxy  and it's also the same mathematically as the spirals in our DNA.

Driving with one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake is likely to get you nowhere  but certainly will burn out vital parts of your car. Similarly  cutting taxes on the middle class  but increasing them on the 'rich' is likely to result in an economic burnout.;Terry Savage;car                   96,,,,,,,,,312
I sort of always had an inkling towards some kind of an art form. I grew up in a very small town  and I just figure-skated. My dad played hockey and I was surrounded by sports  but it wasn't quite doing it for me. I wasn't totally fulfilled  and I did a lot of skating.;Rachel McAdams;sports                   96,,,,,,,,,312
I was sort of in denial about doing country for awhile but I sort of grew up and realized who I was  what I wanted to say. I think country music is the best music in the world and I'm glad to be doing a country album. I hope people will love it as much as I loved making it.;Lucy Hale;hope                     99,,,,,,,,,312
A lot of the songs start with an image.

I think 'Tattoo''s a song that can go so many different ways. Some people think of it as a break-up song  but  for me  it's about somebody who comes into your life and really touches you - be they a friend  a family member or someone you're in a relationship with.;Jordin Sparks;relationship                  104,,,,,,,,,312
I have found little that is 'good' about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash  no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud  or perhaps even think.;Sigmund Freud;good                    107,,,,,,,,,312
Raising taxes is the last thing we should do amid the weakest economic recovery since World War II. Unfortunately  even if we avoid the full 'Taxmageddon' scenario  President Obama's health care law also contains a new surtax on investment that will take effect in 2013.;John Cornyn;health                    113,,,,,,,,,312
I also think we need to maintain distinctions - the doctrine of creation is different from a scientific cosmology  and we should resist the temptation  which sometimes scientists give in to  to try to assimilate the concepts of theology to the concepts of science.;John Polkinghorne;science                   113,,,,,,,,,312
I just went off for two months traveling around Europe on a motorcycle and pretty much turned my phone off. I did 5 000 miles with my dad.

I would love to have dinner with Jay-Z and Beyonce. I think we would have a lot to chat about. I like them both so much  and I love them as a couple.

The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to the purpose for which it is used  and thus in the case before us it cannot be immaterial what plants are subjected to experiment and in what manner such experiment is conducted.;Gregor Mendel;fitness                     121,,,,,,,,,312

As a kid I was short and only weighed 95 pounds. And though I was active in a lot of Sports and got along with most of the guys  I think I used comedy as a defense mechanism.

The word 'geek' today does not mean what it used to mean. A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks  video game geeks  car geeks  military geeks  and sports geeks.

You can't get rid of it with exercise alone. You can do the most vigorous exercise and only burn up 300 calories in an hour. If you've got fat on your body  the exercise firms and tones the muscles.

The TV business is uglier than most things.

There is no way that writers can be tamed and rendered civilized or even cured.

In government offices which are sensitive to the vehemence and passion of mass sentiment public men have no sure tenure.

I pity the young woman who will attempt to insinuate herself between my mama's boy and me. I sympathize with the monumental nature of her task.

I've got a real sense of three-dimensional geometry. I can look at a flat piece of fabric and know that if I put a slit in it and make some fabric travel around a square  then when you lift it up it will drape in a certain way  and I can feel how that will happen.;Vivienne Westwood;travel                    169,,,,,,,,,312

It's amazing that you can listen to any song and you can always tell when there's some substance beneath it and when there isn't.

My opinion is the greatest reward that any government could get is the approval of the people.

It is hard to miss the irony in the fact that the very same week that Republicans were publicly heralding Congressman Paul Ryan's plan to inject market forces into the American health care system  they were crafting a budget deal to strip them from the health reform law.;Ron Wyden;health                     195,,,,,,,,,312
Governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever.

I look at my little girl and I wonder what she's going to be and what she's going to do and what is it that leads girls certain directions in life.

I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn't have to.

But one of the hardest things for me to do was to access anger. I could do it on stage. But when I did it on film it was hard for me. That probably has to do with the intimacy of film.

The ultimate goal of the educational system is to shift to the individual the burden of pursing his own education.

I studied Hitchcock a little bit at University and knew the famous story about the Birds - that he'd tortured Tippi for a day using real birds.

Government does not have a revenue problem government has a spending problem. Government does not have a revenue problem government has a priority problem.

The consuming desire of most human beings is deliberately to plant their whole life in the hands of some other person. I would describe this method of searching for happiness as immature.

I love Charlie  Billy Burke's character. Writing for him is so spectacular  he's so funny and wry and every scene he's in he just takes.

The way I look at it  everything is a trade. You acquire some money  so then you've got no financial burdens  but everyone wants your money and so who can you trust?

Hope  in this deep and powerful sense  is not the same as joy that things are going well  or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success  but rather an ability to work for something because it is good.;Vaclav Havel;work                 23,,,,,,,,,313
After I had the Caesarean  I was told I had really strong stomach muscles and so would heal very quickly. And I did. I was up walking about within three hours. Six days after having her  I was out shopping and shortly after that I made it to David Walliams' wedding.;Denise Van Outen;wedding                    25,,,,,,,,,313
Another hero was Tom Swift  in the books. What he stood for  the freedom  the scientific knowledge and being and engineer gave him the ability to invent solutions to problems. He's always been a hero to me. I buy old Tom Swift books now and read them to my own children.;Steve Wozniak;freedom                   26,,,,,,,,,313
One afternoon when I was 9  my dad told me I'd be skipping school the next day. Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test  a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match. It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan.;Hugh Jackman;sports                    26,,,,,,,,,313
There's the issue of hunger  and there's an issue of if you're going to cut out food programs. We should be focusing on healthy food. Right now  fruits and vegetables are very expensive. So what can we do on the policy side to bring the cost of fruits and vegetables down?;Tom Colicchio;food                    27,,,,,,,,,313
I did not want to be a tree  a flower or a wave. In a dancer's body  we as audience must see ourselves  not the imitated behavior of everyday actions  not the phenomenon of nature  not exotic creatures from another planet  but something of the miracle that is a human being.;Martha Graham;nature                27,,,,,,,,,313
Not just Christians and Jews  but also Muslims  Buddhists  Hindus and the followers of many other religions believe in values like peace  respect  tolerance and dignity. These are values that bring people together and enable us to build responsible and solid communities.;Alcee Hastings;respect                 28,,,,,,,,,313
Technology is a wonderful tool  but also if used incorrectly a horrible tool. We're fascinated by all aspects of it  whatever makes our human lives easier on the planet  but eventually there will have to be some sort of merger. The fascination isn't going to die down.;Reggie Watts;technology                   30,,,,,,,,,313
Being a good Hans Haacke student  part of his influence on me is that there's no difference between a gallery show and a film - or even an ad and a T-shirt-in terms of cultural legitimacy. They're just different contexts in which to have some sort of communication.;Mike Mills;communication                     32,,,,,,,,,313
There's already a marriage clock  a career clock  a biological clock. Sometimes being a woman feels like standing in the lobby of a hotel  looking at the dials depicting every time zone in the world behind the front desk - except they all apply to you  and all at once.;Sloane Crosley;marriage                  32,,,,,,,,,313
If we became students of Malcolm X  we would not have young black men out there killing each other like they're killing each other now. Young black men would not be impregnating young black women at the rate going on now. We'd not have the drugs we have now  or the alcoholism.;Spike Lee;men                    34,,,,,,,,,313
What appeals to me? There are things  points of view  uses of the language  habits of dress  ways of thought and believing that came to me from my grandparents and came to them from theirs. Things that are of good use in any situation  no matter what the future may hold.;Tommy Lee Jones;future                 36,,,,,,,,,313
I know that campaigns can seem small  and even silly. Trivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. And the truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising.

It's difficult to do a genre film well  and it doesn't matter if you're talking vampire movies or 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Thing' or 'Escape From New York.' Those kind of movies  they understand what the old-school B-movie is supposed to be  they get the throwback of it.;Ethan Hawke;movies                   38,,,,,,,,,313
When a mother quarrels with a daughter  she has a double dose of unhappiness hers from the conflict  and empathy with her daughter's from the conflict with her. Throughout her life a mother retains this special need to maintain a good relationship with her daughter.;Terri Apter;relationship                    38,,,,,,,,,313
There should be a sympathy with freedom  a desire to give it scope  founded not upon visionary ideas  but upon the long experience of many generations within the shores of this happy isle  that in freedom you lay the firmest foundations both of loyalty and order.;William E. Gladstone;sympathy                  39,,,,,,,,,313
I can't believe it's been four years now  and from watching that pilot  we really all looked like babies. It's unbelievable just how far everything has come. I'm happier now than I've ever been on the show and in my life. I really owe so much of my happiness to 'Glee.';Lea Michele;happiness                    40,,,,,,,,,313
Just because you've made a couple movies  you've done some good movies  you've been nominated for some Academy Awards  whatever  nobody's entitled. It's a business. If they don't see it  I can think they're wrong  but I'm not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.;Edward Norton;movies                40,,,,,,,,,313
To seek understanding before taking action  yet to trust my instincts when action is called for. Never to avoid danger from fear  never to seek out danger for its own sake. Never to conform to fashion from fear of eccentricity  never to be eccentric from fear of conformity.;Steven Brust;fear                   42,,,,,,,,,313
We don't really go in for big family dinners  but Scottish people are famously confrontational. It's a cultural thing  so maybe we don't need to have them to clear the air. Also  traditional family food isn't as nice here so there's no payoff for traveling hundreds of miles.;Denise Mina;food                   44,,,,,,,,,313
As we get closer to the end of this Congress  we should be addressing the urgent needs of the American people - the war in Iraq  affordable health care  a sensible energy policy  quality education for our children  retirement security  and a sound and fair fiscal policy.;Chris Van Hollen;health                44,,,,,,,,,313
Pretty soon we'll have robots in our society  you're going to have a lot of automated processes that used to be done by people - this is happening. Society and technology is changing so fast  and the impact of the change on society and technology is global  not local.;Jose Padilha;technology                   44,,,,,,,,,313
It would be great if politics were fact-based  but it is not  and it is surely not nuance-based. What works in a classroom or a think tank does not work on Capitol Hill or in the White House. Obama sometimes seems to be running the Brookings Institution  not the country.;Jon Meacham;politics                   45,,,,,,,,,313
When you put something out there into the world  there's all these words you don't want to hear  that you hope people don't say. I don't like anything that starts with 're' - like retro  reinvent  recreate - I hate that. It's always like living in the past - copying  emulating.;Jack White;hope                 47,,,,,,,,,313
By virtue of some of the ways the game is played  in terms of message discipline  in terms of access for reporters  and especially in the way that sources and subjects  especially famous subjects  treat the media  almost by default there's more news that's falling into books.;Ron Suskind;famous                48,,,,,,,,,313
I'm looking at working with people I get on with  that respect me  that don't just see me as a piece of ass. Which I have experienced as well. I've nearly walked off very big films before  and I would  because I don't want that in my life. I want to enjoy the work I do.;Gemma Arterton;respect                  48,,,,,,,,,313
Our scientific age demands that we provide definitions  measurements  and statistics in order to be taken seriously. Yet most of the important things in life cannot be precisely defined or measured. Can we define or measure love  beauty  friendship  or decency  for example?;Dennis Prager;beauty                54,,,,,,,,,313
If you do your research on hot springs all over the world  they're usually places of peace. People  even in warring nations and so forth  they'll go and live in peace together around the hot springs  which were always considered medicinal. I firmly believe in water therapy.;Larry Hagman;peace                  57,,,,,,,,,313
Barack Obama's life was so much simpler in 2009. Back then  he had refined the cold act of blaming others for the bad economy into an art form. Deficits? Blame Bush's tax cuts. Spending? Blame the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. No business investment? Blame Wall Street.;John Sununu;business                     58,,,,,,,,,313
If I was designing a web site for elementary school children  I might have a much higher percentage of older computers with outdated browsers since keeping up with browser and hardware technology has not traditionally been a strong point of most elementary schools.;Mike Davidson;technology                     60,,,,,,,,,313
I really have created a family. I work with the people I love  I travel with them  I make films with them  and I'm in an office with them. So in a weird way - I know I haven't birthed a child - I feel that I'm a part of creating a family. It's a tribe. I love that word.;Drew Barrymore;family                   61,,,,,,,,,313

I've never had any illusions about being a lead actor in films  because lead actors have to be of a certain kind. Apart from the beauty of looks and figure  which I cannot claim to have  there's just a particular kind of ordinary-Joe quality that a film star needs to have.;Stephen Fry;beauty                   62,,,,,,,,,313
Art owes its origin to Nature herself... this beautiful creation  the world  supplied the first model  while the original teacher was that divine intelligence which has not only made us superior to the other animals  but like God Himself  if I may venture to say it.;Giorgio Vasari;intelligence                 64,,,,,,,,,313
Despite the amazing diversity we're blessed with in this country  schools are still in large part segregated because of economic disparity.

If I can procure three hundred good substantial names of persons  or bodies  or institutions  I cannot fail to do well for my family  although I must abandon my life to its success  and undergo many sad perplexities and perhaps never see again my own beloved America.;John James Audubon;success                 64,,,,,,,,,313
I do support a sex-positive attitude for young people. Use condoms  that's important. I love the idea that promiscuity can be healthy but it's got some dodgy crevasses. Ooh  that's a bad reference! But it's got some dangerous cavities there. You know what I'm saying.;Rachael Taylor;attitude                    66,,,,,,,,,313
I hate politics. It's slimy. Any job where people pander for votes  I don't like. The country has gotten so partisan that if you're not on my side  you're the enemy. The only thing I ever try to support is a third party  like Unity08. We need more parties and more choice.;Mark Cuban;politics                   66,,,,,,,,,313
I knew from the beginning that privacy was going to be a huge issue  especially with regard to applying Total Information Awareness in counterterrorism. Because if the technology development was successful  a logical place to apply it was inside the United States.;John Poindexter;technology                    67,,,,,,,,,313
Are ideals confined to this deformed experiment upon a noble purpose  tainted  as it is  with bargains and tied to a peace treaty which might have been disposed of long ago to the great benefit of the world if it had not been compelled to carry this rider on its back?;Henry Cabot Lodge;peace                   68,,,,,,,,,313
There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man  beyond history  and beyond science. The moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit.;Ansel Adams;experience                    69,,,,,,,,,313
My faith is very private to me. It plays an important part in my life  but I do not try and throw my beliefs at others. I have tremendous respect for all faiths and beliefs  but have a deep concern that religion and faith are currently a long way apart from each other.;Rick Wakeman;religion                    69,,,,,,,,,313
At a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society  when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research  it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role  and conduct themselves accordingly.;Joseph Rotblat;science                   72,,,,,,,,,313
I fear dying in the middle of a book. It would be so annoying to write 80 000 words and not get to the end. I'm phobic about it. So when I'm writing a book I leave messages all over the house for people to know how the story ends  and then someone can finish it for me.;Anthony Horowitz;fear                    73,,,,,,,,,313
Health care is one-sixth of our economy. If the government can control that  they can control just about everything. We need to understand what is going on  because there are much more economic models that can be used to give us good health care than what we have now.;Benjamin Carson;health                    75,,,,,,,,,313
Who knows better than artists how much ugliness there is on the way to beauty  how many ghastly  mortifying missteps  how many days of granitic blockheadedness and dismaying ineptitude there is on the way to accomplishment  how partial all accomplishment is  how incomplete?;Tony Kushner;beauty                 77,,,,,,,,,313
You watch an old 'Jeopardy!' and the categories alone are very plain. 'Poetry ' or 'Movies ' or 'Physics.' If you watch it now  though  there'll be a theme board where the categories are all Hitchcock movies. Lots more jokes  lots more high-concept categories and questions.;Ken Jennings;poetry                 77,,,,,,,,,313
I realised the bohemian life was not for me. I would look around at my friends  living like starving artists  and wonder  'Where's the art?' They weren't doing anything. And there was so much interesting stuff to do  so much fun to be had... maybe I could even quit renting.;P. J. O'Rourke;art                  78,,,,,,,,,313
We tried to approach this as though there's never been a Superman movie before  but at the same time respecting the canon and mythology. There are the pillars that you have to respect  and I'm not about to break them. But it is fun for me to bend them and mess with them.;Zack Snyder;respect                    78,,,,,,,,,313
All women have a perception much more developed than men. So all women somehow  being repressed for so many millennia  they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love. And this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society.;Paulo Coelho;women                    78,,,,,,,,,313
I would like to mention that I have flown the 262 first in May '43. At this time  the aircraft was completely secret. I first knew of the existence of this aircraft only early in '42 - even in my position. This aircraft didn't have any priority in design or production.;Adolf Galland;design                     80,,,,,,,,,313
Each person has inside a basic decency and goodness. If he listens to it and acts on it  he is giving a great deal of what it is the world needs most. It is not complicated but it takes courage. It takes courage for a person to listen to his own goodness and act on it.;Pablo Casals;courage                     87,,,,,,,,,313
I was cast in 'Thor' and I'm cast as a Nordic god. If you know anything about the Nords  they don't look like me but there you go. I think that's a sign of the times for the future. I think we will see multi-level casting. I think we will see that  and I think that's good.;Idris Elba;future                    87,,,,,,,,,313
The enemy is not just terrorism. It is the threat posed specifically by Islamist terrorism  by Bin Ladin and others who draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within a minority strain of Islam that does not distinguish politics from religion  and distorts both.;John Cornyn;politics                    90,,,,,,,,,313

Want of money and the distress of a thief can never be alleged as the cause of his thieving  for many honest people endure greater hardships with fortitude. We must therefore seek the cause elsewhere than in want of money  for that is the miser's passion  not the thief s.;William Blake;money                   91,,,,,,,,,313
Having robbed children of any sense that their Father is in Heaven and that they are His creation  we then launched an experiment in raising them without earthly fathers too.

Imagine if you had baseball cards that showed all the performance stats for your people: batting averages  home runs  errors  ERAs  win/loss records.

I was terrified to do 'G.I. Joe.' I had no idea how to do one of those movies. I was kind of scared. You know  if one of those doesn't work  it's a huge hit on your career. People are like  'Well he couldn't make a $170 million movie work. I don't want him in my film.';Channing Tatum;movies                   109,,,,,,,,,313
I am a technological activist. I have a political agenda.

My dream career would be to be in things that have real heart and are telling real stories but while doing that  you're getting really big laughs. I don't necessarily love the straight crazy comedies. 'Caddyshack' is amazing  but there's not a lot of new 'Caddyshack's.;Jake Johnson;amazing                    111,,,,,,,,,313
The Chinese art world does not exist. In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights  anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence.

It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life  the children those who are in the twilight of life  the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life  the sick  the needy and the handicapped.;Hubert H.

The compulsion to do good is an innate American trait. Only North Americans seem to believe that they always should  may  and actually can choose somebody with whom to share their blessings. Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts.;Ivan Illich;attitude                    115,,,,,,,,,313
A lot of journalism wants to have what they call objectivity without them having a commitment to pursuing the truth  but that doesn't work. Objectivity requires belief in and a commitment toward pursuing the truth - having an object outside of our personal point of view.;Nate Silver;truth                     115,,,,,,,,,313
I have to struggle to change people's perceptions of me. I grew very frustrated with the perception that I'm this shy  retiring  inhibited aristocratic creature when I'm absolutely not like that at all. I think I'm much more outgoing and exuberant than my image.;Helena Bonham Carter;change                    117,,,,,,,,,313
And I like the look on people's faces when I say I'm doing this movie called Pride and Prejudice and they kind of smile  and then I say I'm in a movie called Doom and they kind of do a double take and try and put the two things together. And they never quite manage to.;Rosamund Pike;smile                     119,,,,,,,,,313
You have to respect your parents. They are giving you an at-bat. If you're an entrepreneur and go into the family business  you want to grow fast. Patience is important. But respect the other party... My dad and I pulled it off because we really respect each other.;Gary Vaynerchuk;respect                     122,,,,,,,,,313
Those who enjoy their own emotionally bad health and who habitually fill their own minds with the rank poisons of suspicion  jealousy and hatred  as a rule take umbrage at those who refuse to do likewise  and they find a perverted relief in trying to denigrate them.;Johannes Brahms;jealousy                   123,,,,,,,,,313
This weird thing happens when you're in a movie that has some level of success. People start offering you all kinds of things  and they just expect you to do them because they'll be good for your career.

Never in our country's history have we witnessed a natural disaster that has impacted so many people in such a wide area.

We may take it to be the accepted idea that the Mosaic books were not handed down to us for our instruction in scientific knowledge  and that it is our duty to ground our scientific beliefs upon observation and inference  unmixed with considerations of a different order.;Asa Gray;knowledge                    131,,,,,,,,,313
I'm kind of a dork. I don't have much game. I'm not particularly comfortable in bars or clubs. I much prefer being home playing Scrabble  having dinner with a couple friends  going to see a movie  or losing a whole weekend to Season 14 of Law and Order or The Simpsons.;Wentworth Miller;home                   136,,,,,,,,,313
The miracles of the church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off  but upon our perceptions being made finer  so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always.;Willa Cather;power                    136,,,,,,,,,313
The war we are fighting today against terrorism is a multifaceted fight.

I can tell you that too much money is corrupting American politics. Don't blame the American public. The U.S. Supreme Court has a lot to answer for  because it has made it impossible for Congress to reduce the corrupting influence of money on American political life.;Peter Singer;politics                     147,,,,,,,,,313
The people who are competing business-wise out there want what other successful labels and artists have. I don't want what they have I want my own path  my own sound  my own identity.

Writing doesn't come real easy to me. I couldn't write a novel in a year. It wouldn't be readable. I don't let an editor even look at it until the second year  because it would just scare them. I just have to trust that all these scraps and dead-ends will find a way.;Charles Frazier;trust                     158,,,,,,,,,313
I got into shape because I took kick-boxing lessons every day to prepare for a fight scene with Taylor Lautner. I really wanted to lie down and eat Chinese food  but I kick-boxed every morning and ran. If someone was filming you with your kit off  you'd do the same thing.;Jason Isaacs;food                    160,,,,,,,,,313
The TV business is uglier than most things.

You're not going to say anything about me that I'm not going to say about myself. There's so many things that I think about myself if someone really wanted to get at me  they could say this and this and this. So I'm going to say it before they can. It's the best policy for me.;Eminem;best                     168,,,,,,,,,313

My main point here is that if you are the child of God and God is a part of you  the in your imagination God suppose to look like you. And when you accept a picture of the deity assigned to you by another people  you become the spiritual prisoners of that other people.;John Henrik Clarke;god                    79,,,,,,,,,314
I have never lied about my relationship with Bill Clinton. The only proven liar  at this point  and the only admitted liar  is Bill Clinton not Gennifer Flowers  not Kathleen Willey  not Paula Jones and not Monica Lewinsky  at this point. He is the only proven liar.;Gennifer Flowers;relationship                79,,,,,,,,,314
It wasn't so long ago that I was a working mom myself. And I know that sometimes  much as we all hate to admit it  it's just easier to park the kids in front of the TV for a few hours  so we can pay the bills or do the laundry or just have some peace and quiet for a change.;Michelle Obama;mom                   80,,,,,,,,,314
It's hard to encapsulate my inspiration because there are so many different looks  but I think it's just like  sexy girl you see walking down the street in a cool outfit. A lot of eyelet  a lot of leather  playing with the hard and the soft  the good and bad inside of us all.;Chloe Sevigny;cool                 81,,,,,,,,,314

But any action is better than no action at all.;Norman Vincent Peale;fear                    85,,,,,,,,,314
A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return. But if a blow were given for such cause  and death ensued  the jury would be judges both of the facts and of the pun  and might  if the latter were of an aggravated character  return a verdict of justifiable homicide.;Oliver Wendell Holmes;death                 89,,,,,,,,,314
I once had a boyfriend who couldn't write unless he was wearing a necktie and a dress shirt  which I thought was really weird  because this was a long time ago  and no one I knew ever wore dress shirts  let alone neckties it was like he was a grown-up reenacter or something.;Susan Orlean;alone                  91,,,,,,,,,314

We have to understand how the extremists got the way they are. Without that kind of understanding  we'd never really get to know them. I put in nothing about their childhoods. But what I have put in is stuff about the weird symbiotic relationship between us and them.;Jon Ronson;relationship                     97,,,,,,,,,314
Some people are cool with the fact that their bodies bear witness to this great thing they produced  their children  and I understand that. But on a personal level  it makes me feel better that my breasts are not down to my knees when I'm undressed in front of my husband.;Patricia Heaton;cool                   99,,,,,,,,,314
What I respect as far as in myself and in others is the spirit of just doing it. For better or worse  it may work and it may not  but I'm going to go for it.

Now I'm a wife and a mother of two. It's a really different role.

President Obama's version of America is a divided one - pitting us against each other based on our income level  gender  and social status. His policies have failed!

My feeling is  if I can't figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays  then I don't deserve to be an owner.;Michael Symon;thanksgiving                    122,,,,,,,,,314

I'm intrigued by films that have a singular vision behind them. A lot of studio movies have ten writers by the time they're done.

What creates freedom? A revolution in the streets? Mass protest? Civil war? A change of government? The ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new?

A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we're pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking  which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.;Jenson Button;car                     175,,,,,,,,,314
Woody Allen is really the ultimate. I love that he believed in himself enough to do what he did.

The reason we are doing these types of pat downs and using the advanced imagery technology is trying to take the latest intelligence and how we know al Qaeda and affiliates want to hurt us  they want to bring down whether it is passenger air craft or cargo aircraft.;John Pistole;technology                     188,,,,,,,,,314
My priority is to turn people - especially kids - on to sports and being active so they don't even have to think about it being good for their health.

Do not imagine that what we have said of the insufficiency of our understanding and of its limited extent is an assertion founded only on the Bible: for philosophers likewise assert the same  and perfectly understand it - without having regard to any religion or opinion.;Maimonides;religion                    190,,,,,,,,,314

Religious institutions should have religious freedom on this issue. No church or minister should ever have to conduct a marriage that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs.

Everyone takes pause at 40. It's the age you have to assess everything in your life. It's the fictitious marker that's always coming up when you're young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40  and be successful by 40. Whatever success means.;Paul Feig;success                     222,,,,,,,,,314

There used to be this feeling under Eisenhower and Kennedy and Roosevelt and Truman that government was a solution. Trust in the presidency fell precipitously under Johnson - real lows.

Jackie Chan is a very good comedy/martial arts star. He does one kind of martial arts that Jet Li doesn't know how to do and Jet Li does a martial art that Jackie Chan doesn't know how to do.

I just thought it could make a really cool movie. It's not that it's just a buddy comedy but it's all about two guys hating each other and towards the end they're good friends.

Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don't tell their real parents about that - you don't want to tell Mom and Dad.

Painting is the most magical of mediums.

I think people should be given a test much like driver's tests as to whether they're capable of being parents! It's an art form. I talk a lot. And I think a lot. And I draw a lot.

When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad's car when he'd be playing old-school music.

I'm lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save.

I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience.

I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old.

The most experience I had in the criminology field is playing a thug as an actor. That was my first paid job.

Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle.

Another important historical factor is the fact that this already very simple religion was further simplified and purified by the early philosophers of ancient China.

Well  I look at it like this: When you go to a restaurant  the less you know about what happens in the kitchen  the more you enjoy your meal.

We should be therefore supporting a larger Europe  and in so doing we should strive to expand the zone of peace and prosperity in the world which is the necessary foundation for a stable international system in which our leadership could be fruitfully exercised.;Zbigniew Brzezinski;leadership                     49,,,,,,,,,316
We're definitely a hodgepodge of influences. Mine  most heavily  would be Southern rock - the Allman Brothers  Lynyrd Skynyrd and stuff like that. Hillary is more from the country side - her mom is Linda Davis  a country singer. Dave  he's a big fan of the Eagles and like that.;Charles Kelley;mom                 49,,,,,,,,,316
There will be trying times during Obama's presidency  and liberty will need staunch defenders. Can Obama reshape liberalism to be  as it was under F.D.R.  a fighting faith  unapologetically patriotic and strong in the defense of liberty? That would be a service to our country.;Bill Kristol;faith                  52,,,,,,,,,316
Whether if soul did not exist time would exist or not  is a question that may fairly be asked for if there cannot be someone to count there cannot be anything that can be counted  so that evidently there cannot be number for number is either what has been  or what can be  counted.;Aristotle;time                  53,,,,,,,,,316
You can't have a university without having free speech  even though at times it makes us terribly uncomfortable. If students are not going to hear controversial ideas on college campuses  they're not going to hear them in America. I believe it's part of their education.;Donna Shalala;education                    54,,,,,,,,,316
An investigator starts research in a new field with faith  a foggy idea  and a few wild experiments. Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work.

But I didn't really enjoy my secondary education that much  probably because I am a very physical person and don't enjoy sitting at a desk all day. I just dragged myself through GCSE and A Levels  so it suited me very much to go on to drama school  which was very active.;Amanda Burton;education                   58,,,,,,,,,316
It's quite a famous story that takes place on Christmas Eve  and the Germans  French  and Scottish are trying to make peace one night and they bury their dead and they play football. I play a German opera singer  in German  which I never have so I am really excited about that.;Diane Kruger;famous                 59,,,,,,,,,316
Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut  no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you're generally better off sticking with what you know. And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.;Donald Trump;experience                     63,,,,,,,,,316
I think the biggest difficulty is that when I'm here in America  there's a necessity of using English  so I really have a great sense of really wanting to learn  but unfortunately when I head back to Japan  the necessity vanishes and so does my enthusiasm about learning.;Chiaki Kuriyama;learning                  63,,,,,,,,,316
I am trying to inspire people to just take control of their oral health  because if we don't take care of our oral health  it affects so many different aspects of our lives.

The trouble with the Labour Party leadership and the trade union leadership  they're quite willing to applaud millions on the streets of the Philippines or in Eastern Europe  without understanding the need to also produce millions of people on the streets of Britain.;Arthur Scargill;leadership                    75,,,,,,,,,316
But in the first Gulf war the United Kingdom was not under any threat from Iraq  and is still less so in the second one. Then there is no justification for obstructing freedom of information  particularly as nations have a right to know what their soldiers are being used for.;Kate Adie;freedom                    79,,,,,,,,,316
It wasn't so long ago that I was a working mom myself. And I know that sometimes  much as we all hate to admit it  it's just easier to park the kids in front of the TV for a few hours  so we can pay the bills or do the laundry or just have some peace and quiet for a change.;Michelle Obama;peace                   80,,,,,,,,,316
I respect people who feel things passionately. I do. But when someone is a judge  that is not what they should bring to the bench. It is not really passion  except in rare instances  that serves the bench well. It is  rather  an ability to understand the law and follow it.;Charles Schumer;respect                 80,,,,,,,,,316
I don't think there's a date minimum or maximum. I don't get the whole 'All right  you've got to wait three days to call after the date.' If I got a number from a girl  I'd call that night. There's no science to it for me. You just do what it is that you feel like doing.;Channing Tatum;science                    81,,,,,,,,,316
Who is there that ever receives a gift and tries to make bargains about it? Let us  then  return thanks for what He has bestowed on us.

We need to recognise that what really matters isn't buying more and more consumer goods  but family  friends  and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives. Helping to reduce the appalling consequences of world poverty should be part of that reassessment.;Peter Singer;family                   87,,,,,,,,,316
I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl because I really believe in love  integrity  and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease. I know that I have sex appeal in my deck of cards. But I like to get people thinking. That's what the stories in my music do.;Katy Perry;good                    87,,,,,,,,,316
Science Fiction is not just about the future of space ships travelling to other planets  it is fiction based on science and I am using science as my basis for my fiction  but it's the science of prehistory - palaeontology and archaeology - rather than astronomy or physics.;Jean M.

Illegal immigrants are beginning to comprise a black market class of workers in our society  jeopardizing the financial health of companies which play by the rules  while themselves vulnerable to the exploitation by those willing to take advantage of their illegal status.;Spencer Bachus;health                    91,,,,,,,,,316
Even the highest forms of sacrificial worship present much that is repulsive to modern ideas  and in particular it requires an effort to reconcile our imagination to the bloody ritual which is prominent in almost every religion which has a strong sense of sin.;William Robertson Smith;religion                     92,,,,,,,,,316
It was something I was more interested in myself. When I went to see my sister dance at ballet  I was really into costumes and the arts  and my family was also supportive of whatever me and my sister wanted to do. I would say I pushed myself the most to be into design.;Christian Siriano;design                    94,,,,,,,,,316
Agricultural practice served Darwin as the material basis for the elaboration of his theory of Evolution  which explained the natural causation of the adaptation we see in the structure of the organic world.

As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time  that doesn't work for me.

My dad's one of my biggest heroes. I also think Paul Newman's an inspiration. I know a lot of people say that  but I love that he's a great role model and a humanitarian.

It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week  the minimum wage  family leave  health insurance  Social Security  Medicare  retirement plans.

No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes.

I grew up when I was 15 when I had my first opportunity in movies. I watched every great movie for a year and a half  and since then I've asked myself how I can emulate such artistry. That's really my motivation. I want to do something as good as my heroes have done.;Leonardo DiCaprio;movies                     116,,,,,,,,,316
I got this idea about being afraid to let go of something and being afraid of sinking into a state of almost anesthesia  where you have to trust other people. Just the paranoia of it all. And it seemed to suit the frenetic track. So I just wrote it out and  you know  said it.;Nick Rhodes;trust                   119,,,,,,,,,316
I genuinely liked all of the cast members very much. Steve had a wicked sense of humor. I remember Russell coming to my rescue  once. I watched Eric evolve before everyone's eyes.

Bad things do happen how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life.

Women are not making it to the top. A hundred and ninety heads of state nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world  thirteen per cent are women.

I think a gentleman is someone who holds the comfort of other people above their own. The instinct to do that is inside every good man  I believe.

The United States established itself as a trustworthy new nation in its first two decades after the Revolutionary War by paying its debts  even when many in the country believed it had no obligation to do so.

My number one goal was not getting 'A's' - and I proved it. I was a 'C' student. You have to be ready to learn. If you're not interesting in learning  it doesn't work.

We can now have action movies with two stars where one might be African American and one might be Asian American.

I'd love to pop back into 'Being Human' as Adam. I love the character so much. I've never really played a character like that.

I have great friends around me that are positive and I think that's the key to life is making your own path.

One thing that happens when you're pregnant is that as your stomach starts to stretch. It itches! So I have to keep my belly really lubricated.

The TV business is uglier than most things.

I got into shape because I took kick-boxing lessons every day to prepare for a fight scene with Taylor Lautner.

I do not pretend to know precisely what is on foot there but I think it pretty evident that there is a very free communication between that country and this body  and unless I am greatly mistaken  I see the dwarfish medium by which that communication is kept up.;Benjamin F.

I was the first in my peer group to get pregnant. All I craved was reassurance. I needed someone to tell me that all the seemingly random symptoms I had - weird things  such as excess saliva - were normal.

I live by 'Go big or go home.' That's with everything. It's like either commit and go for it or don't do it at all. I apply that to everything.

My name is James Edward Franco. Ted is a nickname for Edward. That's what my parents called me. I also got 'Teddy Ruxpin' a lot. It just got to a point where I got sick of it  so when a teacher called out 'James Franco' my junior year of high school  I didn't correct her.;James Franco;teacher                    174,,,,,,,,,316
Zionism was originally a rebellion against religious Judaism and the PLO Charter was essentially secularist.

Woody Allen is really the ultimate. I love that he believed in himself enough to do what he did.

I think sometimes all you need is to hear someone else say the same thing that you're going through to realize that you're not alone.

I have no control over people's perceptions of me at all and that's one of the things I decided very early on is that I can't control the way other people think of me.

Standing beneath the white light of an Apple store is like standing on a Stanley Kubrick movie set. His '2001: A Space Odyssey' predicted Jobs and a future where technology was our friend.

The last thing I want my child to see is Dad running around in the middle of the pack. That would really upset me. And that would upset him.

Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don't think she's dating for love - I think she's dating for creativity.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society.

I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother's Morris Minor. I drove it around my father's farm.

About 15 years ago I went though a period of a year or so when I just couldn't find anything good. My wife noticed I was having trouble reading menus.

I really  specifically  love acting  and I think it's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that.

The kind of theater that I do is sort of 'narrative realism ' which I think in the broadest sense is legitimate to say is mainstream.

I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl because I really believe in love  integrity  and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease.

I feel connected to the Second World War because my father lost his father in that war. So  through my dad and the effect it had on him of losing his father young  I always felt connected to the war.

Happiness is a sunbeam which may pass through a thousand bosoms without losing a particle of its original ray nay  when it strikes on a kindred heart  like the converged light on a mirror  it reflects itself with redoubled brightness. It is not perfected till it is shared.;Jane Porter;happiness                   113,,,,,,,,,317
What you have in most education software is that they're catering to the decision-maker who makes the budget allocations  and that decision-maker has a lot of check boxes. Does it do this? Check. Does it do that? Check. They could care less about the end user experience.;Salman Khan;education                     120,,,,,,,,,317
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith  and people of no faith. But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world.;Gordon Brown;faith                     121,,,,,,,,,317
The best thing that ever happened to me is that nothing happened in writing. I ended up working for engineering companies  and that's where I found my material  in the everyday struggle between capitalism and grace. Being broke and tired  you don't come home your best self.;George Saunders;home                   121,,,,,,,,,317
It certainly is dangerous that there are only a few clubs left in Europe that can afford to pay millions. At the end of the day however  the spectators decide the rates of pay - by watching the games and consuming the goods and services advertised on sports TV programmes.;Angela Merkel;sports                     135,,,,,,,,,317
Blackheart Records being 25 years old represents staying power and the fact that we weren't able to get a record out through conventional means  so we had to create this record company to put out our records if we wanted to be a band that had records to give out to their fans.;Joan Jett;power                     143,,,,,,,,,317
History is filled with tragic examples of wars that result from diplomatic impasse.

The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for life. For this task  it has a rudimentary nervous system.

The great book for you is the book that has the most to say to you at the moment when you are reading. I do not mean the book that is most instructive  but the book that feeds your spirit. And that depends on your age  your experience  your psychological and spiritual need.;Robertson Davies;age                   150,,,,,,,,,317
We can now have action movies with two stars where one might be African American and one might be Asian American. One of them doesn't have to be white  and the other one doesn't have to be the ethnic sidekick. We're way over that. And I think it's happening in society  too.;Roger Ebert;society                    150,,,,,,,,,317
Introspection and preserved writings give us far more insight into the ways of past humans than we have into the ways of past dinosaurs. For that reason  I'm optimistic that we can eventually arrive at convincing explanations for these broadest patterns of human history.;Jared Diamond;history                     152,,,,,,,,,317
The Teen Challenge ministry was born out of those humble early days of ministry. It now includes over 500 drug and alcohol rehab centers around the world  even in Muslim countries.

The most important thing about global warming is this. Whether humans are responsible for the bulk of climate change is going to be left to the scientists  but it's all of our responsibility to leave this planet in better shape for the future generations than we found it.;Mike Huckabee;future                     154,,,,,,,,,317
A number of scientists with greatly different backgrounds can come up with completely different assessments. The discussions or controversies are endless. Once a year  we try to bring the most important discoverers together to exchange their experiences and knowledge.;Richard Leakey;knowledge                     166,,,,,,,,,317
What creates freedom? A revolution in the streets? Mass protest? Civil war? A change of government? The ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new? History  more often than not  shows that hopes raised by such events are often dashed  sooner rather than later.;Jonathan Sacks;change                   168,,,,,,,,,317
With success came an ever-growing burden of responsibility. I lived with a near-constant low-level anxiety that I would make a mistake that would not only threaten my career  but also my brothers' - not to mention the livelihoods of many people who work with us or for us.;Donny Osmond;success                     173,,,,,,,,,317
It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined  permanently blocked  as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.;Richard P. Feynman;hope                    175,,,,,,,,,317
Most of the time it's the role. Sometimes it's the story and sometimes it just the paycheck. It's the little movies that come out as stories or the fact that I have work to go out  you know what I'm saying  you can only be out so long without work  you start getting antsy.;Morgan Freeman;movies                   179,,,,,,,,,317
The conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that people who investigate heresies must be heretics just as if a doctor who studies leprosy must be a leper. Indeed  it is only recently that science has been allowed to study anything without reproach.;Aleister Crowley;science                     181,,,,,,,,,317
I really love the independent movies and I just think that sometimes when they throw a lot of money into it and a lot of special effects and a lot of stunts that you lose the connection  the human connection and I personally love movies that are about the human connection.;Jane Seymour;movies                     185,,,,,,,,,317
I think feminism's a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There's nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules  so everybody's confused. And dating becomes a sloppy  uncomfortable  unpleasant thing.;Zosia Mamet;dating                   188,,,,,,,,,317
I'm an afternoon tea type of girl. I come from a Russian background where we love our teas.

President Obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for Catholic medical providers from the get-go. It's about time all people of faith fought back against this unprecedented encroachment on religious liberty. First  they came for the Catholics. Who's next?;Michelle Malkin;faith                     229,,,,,,,,,317
Most of us really aren't horribly unique. There are 6 billion of us. Put 'em all in one room and very few would stand out as individuals. So maybe we ought to think of worth in terms of our ability to get along as a part of nature  rather than being the lords over nature.;Herbert Simon;nature                     230,,,,,,,,,317
I think L.A.'s terrific. You fly an hour and a half and you're in the mountains in three feet of powder. I also think it's a much better city if you're working as an actor. If you're not working and you don't see your dreams coming true  there can be a lot of heartache.;Scott Patterson;dreams                     236,,,,,,,,,317
The U.S. army confirmed that it gave a lucrative fire fighting contract in Iraq to the firm once run by the Vice President Dick Cheney without any competitive bidding.

I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality...

I told you I'm not going to criticize my successor. I'll just tell you that there are people at Gitmo that will kill American people at a drop of a hat and I don't believe that persuasion isn't going to work.

Liberals in Congress have spent the past three decades pandering to environmental extremists. The policies they have put in place are in large part responsible for the energy crunch we are seeing today. We have not built a refinery in this country for 30 years.;Marsha Blackburn;environmental                      292,,,,,,,,,317
The real cure for our environmental problems is to understand that our job is to salvage Mother Nature. We are facing a formidable enemy in this field. It is the hunters... and to convince them to leave their guns on the wall is going to be very difficult.;Jacques Yves Cousteau;environmental                      292,,,,,,,,,317
I'm not comfortable being around too many people. I don't like being out in public too much. I don't like going to bars. I don't like doing celebrity stuff. So most of the characters I play are people who don't always feel comfortable beyond their small circle of friends.;Adam Sandler;famous                      292,,,,,,,,,317
What we have at present is a system of loss socialism. Whatever goes wrong is shouldered by the general public and anything that works is privatised. Worshippers of market freedom have suspended the most important economic principle: Risk and liability go hand in hand.;Sigmar Gabriel;freedom                      292,,,,,,,,,317
I think that we could be more careful about what we're saying to young women in terms of their expectations. It's unrealistic to expect people to always be in designer clothes. Girls growing up deserve more freedom in how they look and how they feel about how they look.;Emily Procter;freedom                      292,,,,,,,,,317
I had been a reporter for 15 years when I set out to write my first novel. I knew how to research an article or profile a subject - skills that I assumed would be useless when it came to fiction. It was from my imagination that the characters in my story would emerge.;Amy Waldman;imagination                      292,,,,,,,,,317
Have you heard of this new thing called the internet? It's giving people new expectations. It's allowing them to become their own expert. Knowledge lies anxious at their fingertips.

The plane took off at 8:10 in the morning - or that's when it was scheduled to take off. And that's when I believe it took off. I had been in my office at the Department of Justice.

There are a lot of Christian fundamentalists there are a lot of Muslim extremists. Every religion - Mormonism - has something way on the side that's completely using the religion as some weird backbone for their twisted faith. It has nothing to do with their religion.;Patrick Wilson;religion                      292,,,,,,,,,317
My wife Elizabeth and I started The Really Terrible Orchestra for people like us who are pretty hopeless musicians who would like to play in an orchestra. It has been a great success.

And I think it's that time. And I think if you just step aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over. You can maybe still use a plane. Though maybe a smaller one.

We managed to put together a compilation that had some creativity to it. In the meantime I was listening to the free radio stations and I noticed that during their war coverage they were playing these songs born out of the Vietnam War that were all critical of the soldiers.;Joni Mitchell;war                      292,,,,,,,,,317
Oh  I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness. You went to the movies then  you saw two movies and a short. When Mickey Mouse came on the screen and there was his big head  my sister said she had to hold onto me. I went berserk.;Maurice Sendak;happiness                   2,,,,,,,,,318
So  basically  my view is I don't want to support the exploitation of animals  and within reason  I will do what I can to avoid it  but it's not like it's a religion for me. It's not like I consider I'm polluted if somehow some bit of milk or cheese or something passes my lips.;Peter Singer;religion                 2,,,,,,,,,318
No  I like to wear as least amount of makeup as I can during my everyday life because I'm just all about keeping my skin healthy and hydrated and I love to laugh and have a great time and smile - that's when I feel the most pretty so I just want to make sure that I stay happy.;Lily Collins;smile                     2,,,,,,,,,318
For  behind the scenes  halfway around the world in Mexico  were two decades of aggressive research on wheat that not only enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient with respect to wheat production but also paved the way to rapid increase in its production in other countries.;Norman Borlaug;respect                   3,,,,,,,,,318
Well  my thoughts about California are kind of mythological. To me  as well as being a real place  it's a place where people go to find something - to find happiness or to realize their dreams. So it has that kind of quality of heroism and heartache  and Australia has that  as well.;Colin Hay;dreams                 4,,,,,,,,,318
Well  you know  a lot of people look at the negative things  the things that they did wrong and - which I do. But I like to stress on the things I did right  because there are certain things that I like to look at from a positive standpoint that are just positive reinforcement.;Tiger Woods;positive                  4,,,,,,,,,318
Well  unfortunately  I have always regretted the fact that I have a temper  but I also have  you know  have great love and respect for all of the people that have worked for me.

For me  just being how old I am  I know I don't want to be a single mom. I really would rather make it a two-person job. But I've also come to terms with not being a mother at all.

Moreover  the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.;Garrett Hardin;power                     8,,,,,,,,,318

Uncontrolled  the hunger and thirst after God may become an obstacle  cutting off the soul from what it desires.

While teaching  I also worked undercover in the lower courts by saying I was a young law teacher wanting experience in criminal law.

I have a really  really  really normal family. And by normal I mean we're all nuts on some level. I think you've gotta be a little nuts to pursue any kind of creative job. I was also a really good kid. I know that sounds really dull  but I didn't rebel in the traditional sense.;Anna Paquin;family                   15,,,,,,,,,318
On the one hand  the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me. But on the other hand  I long for it  you know what I mean? I'm constantly in conflict with things.

I had a teacher  he was 86 years old and his name was Luigi in New York City  and he said  'Never stop moving. You get to reinvent yourself.' So you have to find ways to reinventing yourself.

Knowledge comes  but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time  but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity.;Calvin Coolidge;wisdom                    15,,,,,,,,,318

To talk about balance  it's easier to talk about what's out of balance. And I think anytime that you have any disease  and disease meaning lack of ease  lack of flow... dis-ease. So any time there's disease  you're out of balance  whether it's jealousy  anger  greed  anxiety  fear.;Ricky Williams;anger             21,,,,,,,,,318
My Food Network shows  'Emeril Live' and 'Essence of Emeril ' are not in production right now  but I wouldn't say that I'm necessarily leaving Food Network. I have a lot of television still in me.

Taxes are like abortion  and not just because both are grotesque procedures supported by Democrats. You're for them or against them. Taxes go up or down government raises taxes or lowers them.

Mankind's true moral test  its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view)  consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.

I came at age in the '60s  and initially my hopes and dreams were invested in politics and the movements of the time - the anti-war movement  the civil rights movement.

When we read stories of heroes  we identify with them. We take the journey with them. We see how the obstacles almost overcome them.

Police and firefighters are great  but they don't create wealth. They protect it. That's crucial. Teaching is a wonderful profession.

Everybody gets typecast in movies  but you have to make wise choices. I'd say around 90 percent of movie casting is about the way you look  so you have to fight that.

Despite my emphasis on technology  I do not view laws as inherently evil. My goals are political ones  even if my techniques are not.

Architecture is involved with the world  but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal.

We can't understand when we're pregnant  or when our siblings are expecting  how profound it is to have a shared history with a younger generation: blood  genes  humor.

I think what I would say to my younger self  and probably to younger  just starting-out writers is that a lot of times you're just afraid to put yourself out there  and it's uncomfortable because it's working up the courage to do something  to push yourself to do those things.;Carol Leifer;courage                  43,,,,,,,,,318

Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix  lose our stuff  and  on occasion  they crash  producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.;Wesley Morris;computers                 46,,,,,,,,,318
If they can prove that I am wrong by that time  I will give it up to their wisdom  but not after to any one's judgment  till I see the end of another year for the Lord will begin with a new century and I will see what he will do  before I will hearken to any man's judgment.;Joanna Southcott;wisdom                  46,,,,,,,,,318
When you go off in the world and make your life  and you come back to your home town  and you find your old high-school friends driving in the same circles  doing the same things  that's what Hollywood's like. It's a little block  little town. It doesn't really grow or change.;Robert Rodriguez;home                 47,,,,,,,,,318
The Deep South has a completely different history  both good and bad  that is fascinating for everybody. It makes people work together who usually don't  and that sounds like a cliche in so many ways  but it actually happened... and it happened because of a beautiful idea.;Genevieve Gorder;history                  49,,,,,,,,,318
If what you do is being threatened as a profession  that could be scary. But that's the same reason why I walked out on stage many times after receiving death threats. I couldn't live without doing what I wanted to do. So at the same time I have to be willing to die for it.;Marilyn Manson;death                     50,,,,,,,,,318
And if you look at the reality in the United States  where you have more than 40 million people below the poverty line and 42 million on food stamps  and then you look at poverty around the world  clearly the way we're running the engine of capitalism is not serving us well.;Simon Mainwaring;food                   51,,,,,,,,,318
I can safely say that other than macaroni and cheese  there's no processed food in my life. There's no inorganic food in my life these days. There's no junk food. There's not a lot of sugar. There's no soy. I mean  really everything that's going into my body is pretty pure.;Ginnifer Goodwin;food                    52,,,,,,,,,318
Tony and I had a good on and off screen relationship  we are two very different people  but we did share a sense of humor  we now live in different parts of the world but when we find ourselves in the same place it is more or less as if there had been no years in between.;Roger Moore;relationship                   52,,,,,,,,,318
As soon as you judge communication a little more rigorously  there is a possibility that the message will not be democratized. I have to say what I believe to be right. I have to spread out the statement among all the means of expression available to us at present.;Alexander Kluge;communication                     59,,,,,,,,,318
I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact  I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble. If you must have it in order to be happy  then you are denying the happiness of the here and now.;Peter McWilliams;success                    59,,,,,,,,,318
Do I ever think Gossip will be really massive in America? No  I don't think it'll happen - and that's fine. It's kind of nice because I get to experience everything at once. I get to come home and it not be weird  like in Paris or something. It is nice to be completely anonymous.;Beth Ditto;home                    60,,,,,,,,,318
I've always had questions about what it meant to be a protester  to be in the minority. Are the people who are trying to find peace  who are trying to have the Constitution apply to everybody  are they really the radicals? We're not protesting from the outside. We're inside.;Gil Scott-Heron;peace                   63,,,,,,,,,318
I had this totally impossible dream of being an actress. Trust me  just because I'm lucky enough to be doing this doesn't make any of this less of a pipe dream. And nothing gets my juices flowing like a really great performance. To see someone on stage  I get really excited.;Olivia Thirlby;trust                    65,,,,,,,,,318
When a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each other  it seems to me  in spite of such obstacles dividing them as parents or husband  that they belong to each other in the name of Nature  and are lovers by Divine right  in spite of human convention or the laws.;Nicolas Chamfort;nature                 66,,,,,,,,,318
My parents had this relationship that was really terrifying. I mean  the level of hatred that they had  and the level of physical abuse - my mother would beat up my father  basically - and I think I was drawn to images on television that were bright and reflective.;Augusten Burroughs;relationship                   67,,,,,,,,,318
I basically believe the medical insurance industry should be nonprofit  not profit-making. There is no way a health reform plan will work when it is implemented by an industry that seeks to return money to shareholders instead of using that money to provide health care.;Dianne Feinstein;medical                     70,,,,,,,,,318
Our religion is itself profoundly sad - a religion of universal anguish  and one which  because of its very catholicity  grants full liberty to the individual and asks no better than to be celebrated in each man's own language - so long as he knows anguish and is a painter.;Charles Baudelaire;sad                   71,,,,,,,,,318
Women have a lot of power in private life. There are many men who would say  'Hey  women already rule my life.' But with women  more is more. The more there are  the more the world gets used to seeing them. We change the culture. We begin to expand options and lead and manage.;Dee Dee Myers;change                  75,,,,,,,,,318
The communitarians may say you've been enjoying too much individual freedom  and that you must give up some of that for the benefit of the community. But they really mean that they want more power over your life - to force you to subsidize  obey and conform to their choices.;Harry Browne;freedom                    75,,,,,,,,,318
Women in particular need to keep an eye on their physical and mental health  because if we're scurrying to and from appointments and errands  we don't have a lot of time to take care of ourselves. We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own 'to do' list.;Michelle Obama;time                    75,,,,,,,,,318
I love to work with the younger kids who are trying to live out their dreams  if in fact that's what they plan on doing after college to take the next step. A very select few have that opportunity so when you do have the opportunity you know  those guys take advantage of it.;Roger Clemens;dreams                    76,,,,,,,,,318
I get very nervous whenever I think about it. I've never done a serious play  and I have such awe of the woman - she's really my only idol. It's going to be a big stretch - certain people come out on stage and your face muscles automatically tense and you get ready to smile.;Judy Holliday;smile                     76,,,,,,,,,318
Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest  best  or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful  wicked  lovable  and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;best                 77,,,,,,,,,318
If you think aficionados of a living Constitution want to bring you flexibility  think again. You think the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. That's flexibility.;Antonin Scalia;death                     79,,,,,,,,,318
Study after study confirms that even when you control for variables like profession  education  hours worked  age  marital status  and children  men still are compensated substantially more - even in professions  like nursing  dominated by women. No wonder there's a gender gap.;Dee Dee Myers;education              83,,,,,,,,,318
Until we have a better relationship between private performance and the public truth  as was demonstrated with Watergate  we as the public are absolutely right to remain suspicious  contemptuous even  of the secrecy and the misinformation which is the digest of our news.;John le Carre;relationship                  84,,,,,,,,,318
My kids will grow up in a house knowing that it's perfectly normal for two men to be in love  it's perfectly normal for two women to be in love. My kids will grow up knowing it's all about love. It doesn't matter who you're with and everyone should have that experience.;Tori Spelling;experience                     92,,,,,,,,,318
I've done my best to work from a place of humility - always looking over your shoulder saying  'Does this suck?' and I think that's a good way to work. The other way to work is where you start to think  'I'm on fire  I'm amazing!' and I don't think that's the way to work.;David O. Russell;amazing                   93,,,,,,,,,318
Time after time we're told corporations should have freedom from pesky job safety regulations  environmental protections and labor standards - giving working people the freedom to be crushed in collapsing mines  choke on filthy air and get paid too little to live on.;Richard Trumka;environmental                    93,,,,,,,,,318
Our marriage is grounded in the word of God. That's really it. God is the core of our marriage  and the foundation and the blueprint for it is how we live  and being open and honest and communicating  but ultimately doing what pleases God  and not in a selfish manner.;Candace Cameron Bure;marriage                  94,,,,,,,,,318
If we're picking people to draw out of their own conscience and experience a 'new' Constitution  we should not look principally for good lawyers. We should look to people who agree with us. When we are in that mode  you realize we have rendered the Constitution useless.;Antonin Scalia;experience                    95,,,,,,,,,318
What might be taken for a precocious genius is the genius of childhood. When the child grows up  it disappears without a trace. It may happen that this boy will become a real painter some day  or even a great painter. But then he will have to begin everything again  from zero.;Pablo Picasso;great                   95,,,,,,,,,318
A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms  'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art                     99,,,,,,,,,318
Consider the perverse effect cap and trade has on altruistic actions. Say you decide to buy a small  high-efficiency car. That reduces your emissions  but not your country's. Instead it allows somebody else to buy a bigger S.U.V. - because the total emissions are set by the cap.;James Hansen;car                    99,,,,,,,,,318
It's funny that there was so much disturbance about having a Catholic in the White House with Kennedy  and when we finally get a religion in the White House that's causing a lot of conflicts  and concerns  and disturbances for a lot of people  it's in the Bush Administration.;Roger Ebert;religion                  101,,,,,,,,,318
Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue  a wonderful living side by side can grow  if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky.;Rainer Maria Rilke;love                    103,,,,,,,,,318
I have found little that is 'good' about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash  no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud  or perhaps even think.;Sigmund Freud;experience                    107,,,,,,,,,318
Being a teen can be tough. Just try to surround yourself with really good friends that really have your back  and also be a really good friend to those who really care about you. If you're not sure about certain things  talk to your friends that you trust and your family.;Victoria Justice;trust                    108,,,,,,,,,318
The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is  of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves  or by any new technology.;Marshall McLuhan;technology                    114,,,,,,,,,318
Where would you be without friends? The people to pick you up when you need lifting? We come from homes far from perfect  so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends - your own chosen family. There's nothing like a really loyal  dependable  good friend. Nothing.;Jennifer Aniston;good                   120,,,,,,,,,318
It disturbs me when Obama says in the State of the Union address that he wants to make dropping out of school at 18 illegal  because people learn differently and before there are forms of learning for every type of person in the world  we shouldn't be condemned for leaving.;Ezra Miller;learning                    123,,,,,,,,,318
I've used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible.

I don't think I'll ever feel as famous or as popular as I felt when I was a 17-year-old soccer player in Modle. Only about 20 000 people live there and 12 000 of them come to every game. Running onto the pitch each week was just the most fantastic feeling. Nothing can beat that.;Jo Nesbo;famous                    125,,,,,,,,,318
I genuinely liked all of the cast members very much. Steve had a wicked sense of humor. I remember Russell coming to my rescue  once. I watched Eric evolve before everyone's eyes. Maurice loved what he did  so. He treated his character with respect  down to the costuming.;Madeleine Stowe;respect                   126,,,,,,,,,318
Americans have so far put up with inequality because they felt they could change their status. They didn't mind others being rich  as long as they had a path to move up as well. The American Dream is all about social mobility in a sense - the idea that anyone can make it.;Fareed Zakaria;change                     129,,,,,,,,,318
My mom was a professional. My dad and mom met each other in a movie called 'New Faces of 1937.'

For a long time many believed that there would be an automatic adjustment and counted on a rapid increase in the wages of the emerging nations  on our advances in technology and the costs of transport preventing disruption.

Are your kids learning the right lessons about 9/11?

The belief that there are other life forms in the universe is a matter of faith. There is not a single shred of evidence for any other life forms  and in forty years of searching  none has been discovered. There is absolutely no evidentiary reason to maintain this belief.;Michael Crichton;faith                    145,,,,,,,,,318
History is filled with tragic examples of wars that result from diplomatic impasse.

I knew that I did not have to buy into society's notion that I had to be handsome and healthy to be happy. I was in charge of my 'spaceship' and it was my up  my down.

I suppose I am a frustrated musician so I annoy my family by playing guitar in the house.

The day when a sportsman stops thinking above all else of the happiness in his own effort and the intoxication of the power and physical balance he derives from it  the day when he lets considerations of vanity or interest take over  on this day his ideal will die.;Pierre de Coubertin;happiness                    163,,,,,,,,,318
I'm convinced that the man who has learned to meditate upon the Lord will be able to run on his feet and walk in his spirit. Although he may be hurried by his vocation  that's not the issue. The issue is how fast his spirit is going. To slow it down takes a period of time.;Charles Stanley;time                     167,,,,,,,,,318

The GAO just released a report that said 22 percent of federal programs fail to meet their objectives.

A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning.

Well  first let me say that I think health care reform is important. It has to be a priority. And our system is broken.

It falls short.;Susan Collins;finance                  4,,,,,,,,,319

I often begin movies with music in my head it's a very important dimension to me. Not just the music itself  but how to use music in film: when and how and subtlety.

It definitely has learning a lesson about the way you're living your life.

When I started law school I was shocked to learn that our legal system traditionally had the man as the head and master of the family. As late as the '70s and '80s when we were fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment  states like Louisiana still had a head and master law.;Patricia Ireland;legal                     216,,,,,,,,,319

I really believe that's one of the many reasons that God had put me right in the middle of the Backstreet Boys. There are so many stars today that don't realize the impact they have on young people.

President Obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for Catholic medical providers from the get-go.

Growing up going to Christian school and the concept that you're born a sinner and you don't really have a choice to change who you are has been hammered into my head and created the entire reason why I made art and made a band and made records called 'Antichrist Superstar.';Marilyn Manson;art                      294,,,,,,,,,319

'Donny and Marie' was a great experience. I tried so hard to be a great talk show host but it's all about relaxing and enjoying it. Marie and I finally figured that out.

I think the most interesting parts of human experience might be the sparks that come from that sort of chipping flint of cultures rubbing against each other.

When I got to France I realized I didn't know very much about food at all. I'd never had a real cake. I'd had those cakes from cake mixes or the ones that have a lot of baking powder in them.

I think top scientists need to be compensated at a different scale in society. Somebody with experience will tell you that true scientists are not motivated by money - they are motivated by the quest itself. That is true.

Uncontrolled  the hunger and thirst after God may become an obstacle  cutting off the soul from what it desires.

When I was little  we had a Golden Book that had all these Disney characters in one portrait on the first page. My dad used to read from it every night.

I think in the end  when you're famous  people like to narrow you down to a few personality traits. I think I've just become this ambitious  say-whatever's-on-her-mind  intimidating person.

When you look at a family  if you have a family that never interacts with each other  never has strong conversation with each other  never has disagreements  nine times out of ten you have a very cold family and they're not going to be  at the end  they're not going to be close.;Mike Singletary;family                25,,,,,,,,,320
A retired teacher paid $62 000 towards her pension and nothing  yes nothing  for full family medical  dental and vision coverage over her entire career.

Technology isn't the enemy  it is our ally  but only if we adopt a new model that puts people before profit.

There is something sinister  something quite biographical about what I do - but that part is for me. It's my personal business. I think there is a lot of romance  melancholy.

In the Pentagon Papers case  the government asserted in the Supreme Court that the publication of the material was a threat to national security. It turned out it was not a threat to U.S. security.

When I first left university  I thought about going into the private sector. But I discovered when I went to interview that I could only have a career in the back office  or doing HR.

I failed the LSAT. Basically  if I had not failed  I'd have been a lawyer and there would be no Spanx. I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course.

When I celebrated my bar mitzvah  there was no cake. Today  there is no such thing as a bar mitzvah in the United States without a special cake.

Police and firefighters are great  but they don't create wealth. They protect it. That's crucial. Teaching is a wonderful profession.

Some major writers have a huge impact  like Ayn Rand  who to my mind is a lousy fiction writer because her writing has no compassion and virtually no humor.

The game in beauty is changing so much  if your product isn't high tech or can't make a unique performance claim - plump your lips  reduce your lines  look glossy  and stay on for 24 hours - you can't go to market today.

We can't understand when we're pregnant  or when our siblings are expecting  how profound it is to have a shared history with a younger generation: blood  genes  humor.

If you wanna know how not secure you are  just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe.

I wanted to be a teacher. I love children  so I wanted to deal with children. Then I wanted to be a veterinarian.

When you go off in the world and make your life  and you come back to your home town  and you find your old high-school friends driving in the same circles  doing the same things  that's what Hollywood's like.

It's been such a deep and amazing journey for me  getting close to John Keats  and also I love Shelley and Byron.

Schools are not intended to moralize a wicked world  but to impart knowledge and develop intelligence  with only two social aims in mind: prepare to take on one's share in the world's work  and perhaps in addition  lend a hand in improving society  after schooling is done.;Jacques Barzun;intelligence                 51,,,,,,,,,320
We've certainly learned a lot of lessons from Katrina  from Rita. Rita was better than Katrina. We're doing a better job planning. We're closer - more closely aligned with the Department of Defense.

I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact  I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble.

If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day  he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer.

I suppose there's a melancholy tone at the back of the American mind  a sense of something lost. And it's the lost world of Thomas Jefferson.

Something's happened in our society which I don't think is beneficial  and that's that you see the public being fed box-office news.

It absolutely helped - to write the father in both 'Juicy' and 'Beasts ' I had to see the whole story from his point of view.

Women in particular need to keep an eye on their physical and mental health  because if we're scurrying to and from appointments and errands  we don't have a lot of time to take care of ourselves.

I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn's work. That is  I love his paintings for what they are not.

I wanted to try to get young people talking about  thinking about  life's big questions-make it cool and OK to wonder about the heart  the soul and free will and God and death and big topics like that  big human topics.;Rainn Wilson;positive                  107,,,,,,,,,320
It is probably safe to say that all the changes of factual knowledge which have led to the relativity theory  resulting in a very great theoretical development  are completely trivial from any point of view except their relevance to the structure of a theoretical system.;Talcott Parsons;knowledge                    108,,,,,,,,,320
We have in this country a federal government that increasingly is engaged in trying to determine which business  which regions  which industries will succeed  which will not through a whole range of economic development  regional development corporate subsidization programs.;Stephen Harper;business                  111,,,,,,,,,320
We believe that if you put in place the mechanisms that allow for personal choice as far as Medicare is concerned  as well as the programs in Medicaid  that we can actually get to a better result and do what most Americans are learning how to do  which is to do more with less.;Eric Cantor;learning                   113,,,,,,,,,320
Technology is like water it wants to find its level. So if you hook up your computer to a billion other computers  it just makes sense that a tremendous share of the resources you want to use - not only text or media but processing power too - will be located remotely.;Marc Andreessen;technology                     113,,,,,,,,,320
Religion is interesting because it brings out the best and the worst in humanity. It can be a source of good deeds  whether it's people from different spiritual backgrounds coming together to help other people in need after a crisis. But it's also a cause for war and bloodshed.;Josh Gad;religion                     114,,,,,,,,,320
Where would you be without friends? The people to pick you up when you need lifting? We come from homes far from perfect  so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends - your own chosen family. There's nothing like a really loyal  dependable  good friend. Nothing.;Jennifer Aniston;family                   120,,,,,,,,,320
I think you may see again a rise at the federal government level for a - a call for the federal constitutional amendment  because people want to make sure that this definition of marriage remains secure  because after all  the family is the fundamental unit of government.;Michele Bachmann;marriage                   120,,,,,,,,,320
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith  and people of no faith. But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world.;Gordon Brown;religion                     121,,,,,,,,,320
One of the joys of being a Christian or being a person of faith is that you believe deep down that death isn't the worst thing  you know. Not living your life: that's the worst thing. And death is not  it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's not  it's not the end of the world.;Gene Robinson;faith                   126,,,,,,,,,320
I was born in the '60s and grew up in the '70s - not exactly the best decade for food in British history. It was horrendous. It was a time when  as a nation  we excelled in art and music and acting and photography and fashion - all creative skills... all apart from cooking.;Heston Blumenthal;food                    143,,,,,,,,,320
Inauthenticity is endemic in American politics today. The political backrooms where I spent much of my career were just as benighted as my personal life  equally crowded with shadowy strangers and compromises  truths I hoped to deny. I lived not in one closet but in many.;James McGreevey;politics                    152,,,,,,,,,320
How thoroughly it is ingrained in mathematical science that every real advance goes hand in hand with the invention of sharper tools and simpler methods which  at the same time  assist in understanding earlier theories and in casting aside some more complicated developments.;David Hilbert;science                    158,,,,,,,,,320
The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is  is that when we succeed  we succeed because of our individual initiative  but also because we do things together.;Barack Obama;government                   159,,,,,,,,,320
I don't want to wake up and be bored. That's probably my greatest fear is to have nothing to do. What better job is there than to play quarterback for an NFL team  and certainly one that I've been on for a long time and had success with?

Michelle Pfeiffer hasn't been finding a lot of work recently because she doesn't like what a woman her age is offered. That's a real double standard.

The way life manages information involves a logical structure that differs fundamentally from mere complex chemistry. Therefore chemistry alone will not explain life's origin  any more than a study of silicon  copper and plastic will explain how a computer can execute a program.;Paul Davies;alone                    174,,,,,,,,,320

It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined  permanently blocked  as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.;Richard P. Feynman;history                    175,,,,,,,,,320
Republicans and Democrats have used accounting gimmicks and competing government analyses to deceive the public into believing that 2 + 2 = 6. If our leaders cannot agree on the numbers  if 'facts' are fictional  how can they possibly have a substantive debate on solutions?;J. C. Watts;government                    185,,,,,,,,,320
Academics often discount the value of top-rated sports programs in helping to develop a campus life and in contributing to the overall success of a college or university.

Young people can get very discouraged and get hooked on drugs or on alcohol because of problems they perceive as insurmountable. It is important that they realize a mistake need not ruin their future  but they must also know that not everything in life is a bed of roses.;Maureen Forrester;future                     199,,,,,,,,,320
The first thing I think about when I wake up most mornings is the fact that I'm tired. I have been tired for decades. I am tired in the morning and I am tired while becalmed in the slough of the afternoon  and I am tired in the evening  except right when I try to go to sleep.;Susan Orlean;morning                    204,,,,,,,,,320
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture  so that Africa is not a net importer of food  but an exporter of food.;Gordon Brown;food                    207,,,,,,,,,320

Americans want and deserve a broad array of health insurance choices so they can identify those that best fit their own individual or family needs. These choices expand when we allow free enterprise to foster innovation  not smother it with taxes and one-size fits all ideology.;Fred Upton;health                     219,,,,,,,,,320
I was brought up by a single mom in a poor town in Arkansas and while some aspects of small-town life were really positive - like the fact that everyone there is really sweet and hospitable - there is also this close-minded mentality  and that naturally made me want to rebel.;Beth Ditto;positive                     233,,,,,,,,,320
An Atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church. An atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said.

Social cohesion was built into language long before Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter - we're tribal by nature. Tribes today aren't the same as tribes thousand of years ago: It isn't just religious tribes or ethnic tribes now: It's sports fans  it's communities  it's geography.;Peter Guber;sports                    243,,,,,,,,,320
I don't think any other holiday embraces the food of the Midwest quite like Thanksgiving. There's roasted meat and mashed potatoes. But being here is also about heritage.

Dont take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of advice to give  with a few exceptions  generalize whatever they did. Dont over-analyze everything.

One of my favorite beauty products is Vincent Longo Water Canvas creamy blush. I have it in every color and I've been using it for 5 years and that's all I put on when I leave the house.

There are two barriers that often prevent communication between the young and their elders. The first is middle-aged forgetfulness of the fact that they themselves are no longer young. The second is youthful ignorance of the fact that the middle aged are still alive.;Jessamyn West;communication                      295,,,,,,,,,320
But my father was also the one who told me I needed to clean up my mouth or I'd never find a man. What's very important to him is manners. Show up on time. Always send thank-you letters.

All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place.;Mitt Romney;god                      295,,,,,,,,,320
I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.;Robert Fulghum;imagination                      295,,,,,,,,,320
The ability to take pleasure in one's life is a skill and is a kind of intelligence. So intelligence is a hard thing to evaluate and it manifests itself in so many different ways. I do think the ability to know how to live a life and not be miserable is a sign of that.;Todd Solondz;intelligence                      295,,,,,,,,,320
You cannot drive a system that's going to be aiming at preventing illness if everyone is not in it. The whole gaming of health insurance and health care in America is based on that fundamental principle: insure people who aren't sick and you don't have to pay more money on them.;Mehmet Oz;money                      295,,,,,,,,,320
I'll never get out of politics. I have friends in public office. I have things that I want to do. You can't go back in life.

When I got to France I realized I didn't know very much about food at all. I'd never had a real cake. I'd had those cakes from cake mixes or the ones that have a lot of baking powder in them. A really good French cake doesn't have anything like that in it - it's all egg power.;Julia Child;power                      295,,,,,,,,,320
NASA has been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achieve.

One of the most difficult things for people who have been successful in sports is adapting to the daily world where you can't get an answer from someone until 5 o'clock tomorrow.

Well  my thoughts about California are kind of mythological. To me  as well as being a real place  it's a place where people go to find something - to find happiness or to realize their dreams. So it has that kind of quality of heroism and heartache  and Australia has that  as well.;Colin Hay;happiness                 4,,,,,,,,,321

With acting  you wanna see if you can get into trouble without knowing how you're gonna get out of it. It's like the exact opposite of war  where you need an exit strategy.

In my family  we let our boys have a say in what veggie side they want for dinner that night. We list off a handful of options and get them excited about helping to plan the dinner menu.

Well you know  I think a lot of us in marriage know that you play different roles at different times.

Quite frankly  Barack Obama knows what it's like to pay a mortgage and student loans.

Knowledge comes  but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time  but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity.;Calvin Coolidge;knowledge                    15,,,,,,,,,321
When you're C.E.O.  you have to have two conditions: first  shareholders need to trust you and want you to head your company. The second is that you need to feel the motivation to do the job.

To talk about balance  it's easier to talk about what's out of balance. And I think anytime that you have any disease  and disease meaning lack of ease  lack of flow... dis-ease.

I honestly don't know  but if America continues to refuse to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions  I see a bleak future not only for American society  but for the world as a whole.

If you know how to read  you have a complete education about life  then you know how to vote within a democracy. But if you don't know how to read  you don't know how to decide.

Throughout the centuries  man has considered himself beautiful. I rather suppose that man only believes in his own beauty out of pride that he is not really beautiful and he suspects this himself for why does he look on the face of his fellow-man with such scorn?;Isidore Ducasse Lautreamont;beauty                     24,,,,,,,,,321
Politics is too partisan  and sometimes patriotism is cast aside. Patriotism is honor and love of your country and your brothers and sisters.

I failed the LSAT. Basically  if I had not failed  I'd have been a lawyer and there would be no Spanx. I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course.

Purity is not imposed upon us as though it were a kind of punishment  it is one of those mysterious but obvious conditions of that supernatural knowledge of ourselves in the Divine  which we speak of as faith. Impurity does not destroy this knowledge  it slays our need for it.;Georges Bernanos;faith                   68,,,,,,,,,321
'I Know You Care' is about my dad. And I haven't seen him for a long  long time. And my parents divorced when I was really young.

I'm a big fan of doing 'Triple D.' But I don't want to do it forever  don't get me wrong! Travel away from my family  are you crazy?

I mean  their businesses will never be the same.;Guy Fieri;travel                   68,,,,,,,,,321
I'm not claiming that football is the nation's salvation in this area  but it's one of them  one little thing that apparently has captured the imagination of a large sector of our society.

Haiti is always talking about decentralization and nothing has been so obvious  perhaps a weakness  as the centralized nature of Haitian society as being revealed by the earthquake. I mean  they lost all these medical training programs because they didn't have them anywhere else.;Paul Farmer;medical                   78,,,,,,,,,321
American stuntmen are smart - they think about safety. When they do a jump in a car  they calculate everything: the speed  the distance... But in Hong Kong  we don't know how to count. Everything we do is a guess. If you've got the guts  you do it. All of my stuntmen have gotten hurt.;Jackie Chan;car                  83,,,,,,,,,321
I feel that directors at times are like the janitors on the set. I am the secretary  I am the organizer  I am the maid  and I ask if they have eaten or rested.

And then she stopped using a journal  but I always write everything down... Anytime I travel  I try and fill up notepads.;Garrett Hedlund;travel                  84,,,,,,,,,321
The fear of the never-ending onslaught of gizmos and gadgets is nothing new. The radio  the telephone  Facebook - each of these inventions changed the world. Each of them scared the heck out of an older generation. And each of them was invented by people who were in their 20s.;Daniel H. Wilson;fear                    86,,,,,,,,,321
I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior. I believe that Jesus died for my sins  and rose again  and that's my belief. I still don't know what 'Christian' means.

A friend gave me a CD of the 'Pathetique' Symphony as a Christmas present. I went home  and I put on the CD expecting to listen to Tchaikovsky. But it started 'ta ta ta taaa.' It was too long for me. I didn't understand it at first  but then I fell in love  in love  in love.;Gustavo Dudamel;christmas                  86,,,,,,,,,321

I think the way things have been left after Iraq is that people won't believe the Government of the day  so they have to know that lessons have been learnt and that all political parties and people  whether they were for or against the invasion of Iraq  have learnt lessons.;William Hague;government                   103,,,,,,,,,321
One of the main reasons I am so drawn to Hitchcock is that he planned his shots way in advance on story-boards  which he designed like classic paintings (he was an art connoisseur). It's why he found shooting on set boring - because he had already composed the film in his head.;Camille Paglia;art                     110,,,,,,,,,321
The Jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world.

And I can tell you that history will back up what I'm about to say and that is that there is no government run by conservatives  Republicans  put whoever you want there  if you give government the opportunity to spend more money than it has  it will do it.

The Iraq war was fought by one-half of one percent of us. And unless we were part of that small group or had a relative who was  we went about our lives as usual most of the time: no draft  no new taxes  no changes.

I'm a big collector of vinyl - I have a record room in my house - and I've always had a huge soundtrack album collection.

At times I've got a really big ego. But I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad I'm some little gal's dad.

That's more than enough.;John Denver;dad                   135,,,,,,,,,321
People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion.

You can design your own life.;Carrie-Anne Moss;religion                    150,,,,,,,,,321
I like both athletic girls and girly girls. It depends on their personality. I like girls who can go out and play sports with me and throw the football around  but you don't want a girl who's too much tougher than you.

What do you mean by faith? Is faith enough for Man? Should he be satisfied with faith alone? Is there no way of finding out the truth? Is the attitude of faith  of believing in something for which there can be no more than philosophic proof  the true mark of a Christian?;Clifford D. Simak;attitude                    159,,,,,,,,,321
Divorce is so common and accepted in America that beating myself up over it may sound ridiculous. But I was raised to believe that divorce wasn't an option to me  divorce equaled failure.

My parents were very permissive when it came to animals. As long as we earned the money to buy them and built whatever structure it was they were going to live in  we could have any kind of pet we wanted. They would have let us have a rhinoceros if we could have afforded it.;Maggie Stiefvater;pet                     162,,,,,,,,,321
What creates freedom? A revolution in the streets? Mass protest? Civil war? A change of government? The ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new?

I'm going to do a lot of weird stuff that's not going to be like me prancing around like an insane 12-year-old.

My mother told me Homer Ditto was not my father. Nope. Mom had had a fling with some other guy who was my dad. Some dude who didn't stick around too long who Mom was happy to get rid of.

It is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and life in them. For it is these that he really and completely understands.

Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who's voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That's who we think about.

I'm always going to get more of a charge playing Chicago than I will Duluth or some place like that.

One of the advantages of moving quickly is if you do something wrong you can change it. What technologies tend to do is they tend to make a lot of mistakes... but then we go back and aggressively attack those mistakes - and fix them.

Many politicians are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom.

None of us had any idea of how successful Downton was going to be. I thought I was signing up for another period drama that had a slightly modern feel.

You cannot drive a system that's going to be aiming at preventing illness if everyone is not in it.

If Obamacare is allowed to stand - and Congress is allowed to make the purchase of government-endorsed health insurance compulsory - there will be no meaningful limit on Washington's reach into the lives of the American people.

I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship.

We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service.

Sometimes when we weep in the movies we weep for ourselves or for a life unlived. Or we even go to the movies because we want to resist the emotion that's there in front of us.

I'm not an Adonis  that's for damn sure. I've never really thought of myself that way  and it doesn't matter to me. My favorite actors aren't Adonises.

Because of my unique experience as my mom's child  the beginning of my journey was more about me trying to figure out who I was on my own.

I think there are four or five interesting pockets where a lot of cool technology companies are getting started. Chicago is one of them. New York is certainly another. Silicon Valley really dominates. And you're seeing some stuff out of Boston and Seattle and down South.;Eric Lefkofsky;technology                      297,,,,,,,,,322
So  I remember when I was a kid  I was waiting for my mom to come home when she was working late  and  you know  I was like  'Oh my God  what happened to her? Is she OK? Did something happen to her getting in the car?' I was a little kid. But those are actually early onsets of anxiety.;Vinny Guadagnino;car               2,,,,,,,,,323

Yes  it must be something that goes very well with my voice  let's say something that I understand that this would be good communication with the others  and I don't pretend for instance  to look for music that would be something that doesn't go with my personality.;Victoria de los Angeles;communication                  3,,,,,,,,,323
For me  it's about the way I carry myself and the way I treat other people. My relationship and how I feel about God and what He does for me  is something deeply personal. It's where I came from  my family  I was brought up in a religious household and that's very important to me.;Beyonce Knowles;family                  6,,,,,,,,,323
Culture  what you believe  what you value  how you live matters. Now  as fundamental as these principles are  they may become topics of democratic debates from time to time  so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.;Mitt Romney;marriage                7,,,,,,,,,323
But look  I was born in 1956  the peak year for births in US history.

You know  the media and politicians are always gonna be in a bit of tension with one another and probably most of the time that's healthy and indeed even creative. But it's where - it's really when news organisations are used as kind of instruments of politics that it gets tricky.;Tony Blair;politics                     8,,,,,,,,,323

I feel like  in a lot of shows where the woman is in charge  the woman is this ball buster and the guy is sort of weak and spineless. And that's never been my experience in a relationship. I think it's much more interesting that the guy is the boss. And there are stakes.;Whitney Cummings;relationship                    11,,,,,,,,,323
While teaching  I also worked undercover in the lower courts by saying I was a young law teacher wanting experience in criminal law.

Greatness lies  not in being strong  but in the right using of strength and strength is not used rightly when it serves only to carry a man above his fellows for his own solitary glory.

But with Christ  we have access in a one-to-one relationship  for  as in the Old Testament  it was more one of worship and awe  a vertical relationship.

Well I do think  when there are more women  that the tone of the conversation changes  and also the goals of the conversation change.

Another argument  vaguer and even less persuasive  is that gay marriage somehow does harm to heterosexual marriage. I have yet to meet anyone who can explain to me what this means.

In the coming years  if not sooner  social media will become a powerful tool that consumers will aggressively use to influence business attitudes and force companies into greater social responsibility - and  I suggest  move us towards a more sustainable practice of capitalism.;Simon Mainwaring;business                  19,,,,,,,,,323
I think in politics  in Congress  you often do things that are Republican  or you do things because you're a Democrat. Sometimes that's good  obviously  and sometimes that's obviously bad.

I don't wilt easily  and a director can't either. He's the captain of the ship and he's got to be in total control. He also has to have respect for the people he's working for.

I met Woz when I was 13  at a friend's garage. He was about 18. He was  like  the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that point. We became good friends  because we shared an interest in computer and we had a sense of humor. We pulled all kinds of pranks together.;Steve Jobs;good                  23,,,,,,,,,323
Politics is too partisan  and sometimes patriotism is cast aside. Patriotism is honor and love of your country and your brothers and sisters. With politics I get the impression that it's all about what's good for the party and not necessarily what's good for the country.;Ricardo Montalban;patriotism                     24,,,,,,,,,323
We talked about many issues  like welfare  is it the way of life or hand up? Talked about size of government  how much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch  we got in the car and I looked over at Chuck and said  'I'll be damned. we're Republicans.';Susana Martinez;car                 27,,,,,,,,,323
There was a perception of me  and I earned it because I was really intense  really gruff. I treated certain people poorly at times. It was because of who I was. It was almost my strength. I came in all business. I tried to find ways to fit in with that demeanor  but it's not easy.;Kirk Gibson;strength                   28,,,,,,,,,323
The stories that I want to tell  especially as a director  don't necessarily have a perfect ending because  the older you get  the more you appreciate a good day versus a happy ending.

When you've been raised in care  rap music isn't just about guns and sexism. They're talking about real things you can hang on to  problems of identity that you have sympathy with.

I don't have a fear factor. Well  not much of one. And I'm willing to risk quite a lot - as a comedian  you're always risking a lot. You're risking failure  especially if you're improvising and going on TV shows trying to make comedy out of thin air. That is quite a risky business.;David Walliams;fear                   32,,,,,,,,,323

With 'Bright Star' and with 'The Piano ' too  I felt a kind of sadness about it being in such a different era  because of my lack of experience with the era. And one of the ways I'd get over it is to remind myself that every film  even if it's contemporary  creates its own world.;Jane Campion;experience                 38,,,,,,,,,323
Girls are taught to sing high and pretty  like Antony  not low and from the guts like Nina Simone. But we're slowly trying to change that.

I've had nine of my books adapted to film  and almost all were enjoyable. I've been very lucky with Hollywood  and look forward to more movies being adapted. But I don't get involved in that process.

I just think it is important that you realize   that you're the best in the world. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican or whether you're libertarian or whatever  you are the best.

I've been in and out of Wall Street since 1949  and I've never seen the type of animosity between government and Wall Street. And I'm not sure where it comes from  but I suspect it's got to do with a general schism in this society which is really becoming ever more destructive.;Alan Greenspan;society                    46,,,,,,,,,323
So long as I can stay mentally alert - inquiring  curious - I want to keep going. I love my wife and my children  but I don't want to sit around at home with them.

The public is upset. If they haven't lost their job  they know somebody that has. If they haven't lost their house  they know somebody that has. What do you do?

I'm very comfortable with the nature of life and death  and that we come to an end.

I'd love to have First Lady Michelle Obama over and ask  'How do you make your marriage work?' I think the president is sexy as all get-out  but he has got to get on her nerves some kind of way.

I am the woman I grew to be partly in spite of my mother  and partly because of the extraordinary love of her best friends  and my own best friends' mothers  and from surrogates  many of whom were not women at all but gay men.

Here's my rule: You always want to pay cash for your own books  because if they look at the name on the credit card and then they look at the name on the book jacket  then there's this look of such profound sympathy for you that you had to resort to this.

I'm not sure anybody's ready to see me in a drama. And loving movies so much  I've seen a lot of comics try to make that transition too fast  and it can be detrimental.

Southeast Asia food uses many different types of spices which are quite new to me  like the curry leaves which I saw at the Kreta Ayer wet market in Chinatown.

I don't mind traveling that much when I can go somewhere and stay there for a while  but touring is different. You rarely see anything.

I've been singing for six years. I've been in and out of the studios with top producers  but it wasn't something I was ready to express to the public or to the press. I wasn't ready to come out.

When I was a kid I didn't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn't say it  but  I didn't think anything was funny.

I'm just confused as to where we lost that in America because it is everyone's God-given right to think the way they think and that's fine.

We don't need to look far and wide to find examples of gluttonous behavior  as they are numerous throughout the history of capitalism.;Simon Mainwaring;history                     214,,,,,,,,,323
The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing and when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs  they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.;Niccolo Machiavelli;men                     228,,,,,,,,,323
Tramping is too easy with all this money. My days were more exciting when I was penniless and had to forage around for my next meal... I've decided that I'm going to live this life for some time to come. The freedom and simple beauty of it is just too good to pass up.;Christopher McCandless;beauty                      298,,,,,,,,,323
It is important to fund young researchers who want to do curiosity-driven research. Curiosity-driven research is a part of life. Some people are curious. They want to learn more about nature and society should help that. It's like art: you can learn more and bring more beauty.;Serge Haroche;beauty                      298,,,,,,,,,323
I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new. What is broken is broken - and I'd rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived.;Margaret Mitchell;best                      298,,,,,,,,,323
We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.;Barack Obama;education                      298,,,,,,,,,323
All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place.;Mitt Romney;family                      298,,,,,,,,,323
People just want to hear some common sense... and I bring to bear the experience in local government and state government and national government - I was the first woman in history on the Senate Finance Committee - not to mention the diplomatic international experience.;Carol Moseley Braun;finance                      298,,,,,,,,,323

One of my favorite things about 'Star Trek' wasn't just the overt banter but the humor in that show about the relationships between the main characters and their reactions to the situations they would face there was a lot of comedy in that show without ever breaking its reality.;J. J. Abrams;humor                      298,,,,,,,,,323
It is true that the aristocracies seem to have abused their monopoly of legal knowledge and at all events their exclusive possession of the law was a formidable impediment to the success of those popular movements which began to be universal in the western world.;Henry James Sumner Maine;knowledge                      298,,,,,,,,,323
I'm a spoilt brat. I thought I was just going to walk in and make movies. But I'd been my own boss for so long that all of a sudden to be facing a roomful of people who were niggling over every little scene... I just thought I'd go back and draw my comics and have a happy life.;Frank Miller;movies                      298,,,,,,,,,323
The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power.;Henry A.

I'm well-travelled so I can see places coming up. I went to St. Croix in the West Indies at Christmas and it had been hit by a really bad tornado. Values there have gone down but I guarantee they will be up again in eight years. So I'll get in now while it's cheap as chips.;Melanie Brown;christmas                      298,,,,,,,,,323
Well  the teacher I studied with for nineteen and a half years was a man named Paul Gavert. He was a great lieder singer  so basically I'm a trained lieder singer because of that teacher. The teacher I currently study with - since 1995 - is Joan Lader  who also studied with Gavert.;Betty Buckley;teacher                   4,,,,,,,,,324
To me  the blues is an infection. I don't think it's necessarily a melancholy thing the blues can be really positive and I think I think anyone and everyone can have a place for the blues. It need not always a woeful  sorrowful thing. It's more reflective it reminds you to feel.;Mick Fleetwood;positive                    5,,,,,,,,,324
Clearly  if it is sensible to hold a referendum on independence  it is crucial that we have one on marriage. It is the only way the country can move forward on this issue. Let all those who have a view on this subject place their trust in the Scottish people and let Scotland decide.;Keith O'Brien;trust                    7,,,,,,,,,324
To be clear  climate change is a true 800 pound gorilla in the room. The effects of global warming threaten global environmental upheaval over the coming century. But for South Florida and the Everglades  it could be our death knell if urgent action is not taken.;Debbie Wasserman Schultz;environmental                    11,,,,,,,,,324
Well I do think  when there are more women  that the tone of the conversation changes  and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that  you've forgotten high school.;Madeleine Albright;change                  15,,,,,,,,,324
Cause and effect  the riddle of all history  is a particular devil in financial history and never more so than today  where entire classes of security are collapsing not on public exchanges and stock-tickers but because there are no markets to establish prices this side of nothing.;James Buchan;history                   16,,,,,,,,,324
When I was younger  I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick-start a horrible reaction in the men in my life. So I bit my tongue. I was left to painstakingly deal with the aftermath of my avoidance later in life  in therapy or through the lyrics of my songs.;Alanis Morissette;anger                    18,,,,,,,,,324
The simpler the food  the harder it is to prepare it well. You want to truly taste what it is you're eating. So that goes back to the trend of fine ingredients. It's very Japanese: Preparing good ingredients very simply  without distractions from the flavor of the ingredient itself.;Joel Robuchon;food                    20,,,,,,,,,324
Feminism is dated? Yes  for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today  but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage  prostitution  forced labor - they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.;Isabel Allende;marriage                  22,,,,,,,,,324
I met Woz when I was 13  at a friend's garage. He was about 18. He was  like  the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that point. We became good friends  because we shared an interest in computer and we had a sense of humor. We pulled all kinds of pranks together.;Steve Jobs;humor                  23,,,,,,,,,324
Nevertheless the passions  whether violent or not  should never be so expressed as to reach the point of causing disgust and music  even in situations of the greatest horror  should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it  and thereby always remain music.;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart;music                 25,,,,,,,,,324
My Botswana books are positive  and I've never really sought to deny that. They are positive. They present a very positive picture of the country. And I think that that is perfectly defensible given that there is so much written about Africa which is entirely negative.;Alexander McCall Smith;positive                     30,,,,,,,,,324
I love art dealers. In some ways  they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is  create their own aesthetic universes  support artists  employ people  and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;money                 32,,,,,,,,,324

When the United States was founded  the very idea of a nation premised on democratic principles of freedom and tolerance was viewed by the vast majority of the world as an experiment doomed to fail. Dictatorships  monarchies  and theocracies had for many centuries ruled the world.;Eliot Spitzer;freedom                   34,,,,,,,,,324
I guess because it feels more open  but I think being married is way sexier  because it's really like your soul partner in a permanent fashion  and then you strive for it to be something permanent  and that type of commitment and trust  if you can achieve it  is so good for the soul.;Leelee Sobieski;trust                34,,,,,,,,,324
In the depth of the near depression  that he faced when he came in  Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress provided 'recovery funds' that literally kept our classrooms open.

I tour alone. There's no sound check  no back up. I stay with the hosts I am in a family home and it's really nourishing. I just have to remember after the show not to run out into the living room in my pyjamas. Every day  it's a new relationship being built. It's odd and wonderful.;Jane Siberry;alone                    36,,,,,,,,,324
Some of us are interested in directors  but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors. You experience the films through the actors  so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.;Danny Boyle;experience                    38,,,,,,,,,324
Girls are taught to sing high and pretty  like Antony  not low and from the guts like Nina Simone. But we're slowly trying to change that. There are so many things we're not told growing up  and it's our true feminist responsibility to take the truth to the people who need to hear it.;Beth Ditto;change                   40,,,,,,,,,324
My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not  and I'm not. But I believe in God  and that there's a higher power and an intelligence that's bigger than us and that we can rely on. It's not just us  thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support.;Ellen DeGeneres;power                   49,,,,,,,,,324
With all the negativity going on in the world right now  people need an escape. When you give them a hit record or a great record  it allows them to escape for at least three to four minutes. They're not thinking bills or economy or immigration or war when you create that kind of ambiance.;Pitbull;war                    55,,,,,,,,,324
You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify  educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny  and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there  if it's received  great  I respect you for receiving it.

We didn't have television until I was about eight years old  so it was either the movies or radio. A lot of radio drama. That was our television  you know. We had to use our imagination. So it was really those two things  and the comics  that I immersed myself in as a child.;Jessica Hagedorn;imagination                  59,,,,,,,,,324
Do I ever think Gossip will be really massive in America? No  I don't think it'll happen - and that's fine. It's kind of nice because I get to experience everything at once. I get to come home and it not be weird  like in Paris or something. It is nice to be completely anonymous.;Beth Ditto;experience                    60,,,,,,,,,324
I'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me  in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down  but you can still get back up.

I still believe that capitalism is too harsh and I believe that  even within that  there is a lot of satisfaction and beauty if you happen to be one of the lucky ones  although that doesn't eradicate the reality of the suffering.

The dumber half of the audience - whether they're male or female  and a lot of them are male - for some reason responds very quickly to the feminine voice. How can I put it? They kind of instantly react to the female voice in a positive way quicker than they would the male voice.;Frank Black;positive                     64,,,,,,,,,324
I think we're the only jokeless show on television. I mean really  we have no setups and no punch lines. It's not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.;Rainn Wilson;funny                     65,,,,,,,,,324
Kids will keep it real. If I've ever had in my life a great anchor  it's them. They get in your head  'don't get too famous.' If you think you're really famous and think you're really hip  go hang out with your kids for an afternoon. That's about as earthbound as it's going to get.;Lionel Richie;famous                   66,,,,,,,,,324
I don't want to get into the 'who's a hostage-taker' discussion here  but what is the estate tax? It's a double tax on death. Economists will tell you that it's really not a tax that soaks the rich  but it's a tax on capital that deprives business investment and therefore job creation.;Paul Ryan;death                    68,,,,,,,,,324
I used to listen to my dad a lot as a way of trying to be close to him  as well  because my parents were divorced and I didn't spend that much time with him.

When a Cabinet Minister who is sacked for telling lies is re-appointed  in the face of every constitutional convention  only for the same man to be sacked again from the same Cabinet for the same offence by the same Prime Minister no wonder the public are cynical about politics.;William Hague;politics                    70,,,,,,,,,324
When you have fans who are hassling you the entire game and you ignore them  they respect you because their job is to try and distract you. And if they don't distract you  that means you're focused on doing your job. And who knows  by the end  sometimes you even win them over.;Robert Griffin III;respect                  75,,,,,,,,,324
As social media is less about technology and more about relationship building  we are starting to see more women have a heavy influence if not dominant role in the social media space. It's no wonder that Facebook is being run in part by chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.;Erik Qualman;technology                     77,,,,,,,,,324
I think that we have a number of different health care challenges in our country  and certainly addressing the uninsured is one  and the second is making sure that those with health insurance actually get the care that they assume they'll have available to them if they get sick.;Debbie Stabenow;health                    80,,,,,,,,,324
I'm not the same person I was. I used to act dumb. It was an act. I am 26 years old  and that act is no longer cute. It is not who I am  nor do I want to be that person for the young girls who looked up to me. I know now that I can make a difference  that I have the power to do that.;Paris Hilton;power                   83,,,,,,,,,324
I really only respect the Arab culture.

My greatest fear is feeling like a professional novelist. Somebody who creates characters  who sits down and has pieces of paper taped to the wall - what's going to happen in this scene  or this act. What I like is for it to be a much more scary  sloppy reflection of who I am.;Jonathan Safran Foer;fear                   89,,,,,,,,,324
Taxation is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society. The higher the tax level  the greater the failure.

When I was a kid I didn't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn't say it  but  I didn't think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn't think anything was funny. I couldn't laugh.;Courteney Cox;home                    107,,,,,,,,,324
And I know I'm supposed to feel guilty for wanting people to buy my books... and books in general? Novels and poetry  they belong to the realm of art. How dirty of us to try to hawk art!

The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. Its as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas  but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow.

What I'd really like to write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie. I feel almost embarrassed revealing this  because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity.;Mindy Kaling;romantic                     127,,,,,,,,,324
I just think that I'll never have plastic surgery if I'm not in front of the camera. If you make your living selling this thing  which is the way you look  then maybe you do it.

My dad is the reason I actually started watching wrestling. My dad was never big into sports we were all big into sports as kids  and he'd go to our Little League games or whatever and not really know what was going on  because he didn't know about sports  but he knew about wrestling.;John Cena;sports                   128,,,,,,,,,324
People are patronizing the theatres with renewed enthusiasm - there is an entire picnic-like attitude when families go out to see movies  which is a very good sign. They want to see larger-than-life characters on the big screen and not just watch movies on television or on DVDs.;Salman Khan;attitude                     136,,,,,,,,,324
Community organizing is all about building grassroots support. It's about identifying the people around you with whom you can create a common  passionate cause.

There's nobody else on the face of this earth that's playing a sport at a highest level... with a transplant.

I can support co-ops if they want to do it as we've known co-ops in America for 150 years - where they serve the purposes of the consuming public  whether it's health care or whether it's co-ops as we know them in the Midwest  providing electricity or to sell supplies to farmer.;Chuck Grassley;health                    145,,,,,,,,,324
I'm terrified of being too famous. What I'm really afraid of is that the audiences will go into the theater and not be able to forget that it's me  that fame will stand in the way of my acting.

And that depends on your age  your experience  your psychological and spiritual need.;Robertson Davies;experience                   150,,,,,,,,,324
The readers are the ones who let us live our dreams. I try to write books which are really compelling - that you'd take on vacation and rather than going out  you'd read in your hotel room because you had to find out what happened. Hopefully that's what readers are responding to.;Harlan Coben;dreams                     157,,,,,,,,,324
Pop stardom is not very compelling. I'm much more interested in a relationship between performer and audience that is of equals. I came up through folk music  and there's no pomp and circumstance to the performance.

I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route  so I had friends in all areas.

It's rather splendid to think of all those great men and women who appear to have presented symptoms that allow us to describe them as bipolar. Whether it's Hemingway  Van Gogh...

I didn't miss training because it had become so painful for me.

The difference between people who believe they have books inside of them and those who actually write books is sheer cussed persistence - the ability to make yourself work at your craft  every day - the belief  even in the face of obstacles  that you've got something worth saying.;Jennifer Weiner;work                   185,,,,,,,,,324

My son had his eighth birthday recently and we had a chance to borrow the film and show it to all of his friends that was at his birthday party and they loved it. I was a little nervous.

It's been really fun to see with each album when I change to see the fans of the show emulate my style and with the first record a lot of the kids in the crowd were wearing neck ties like I was and now you'll see a lot of girls with pink hair.

I'm not convinced that women have the education or the sense of their own history enough or that they understand the cruelty of which men are capable and the delight that many men will take in seeing you choose to chain yourself - then they get to say 'See  you did it yourself.';Alice Walker;history                     256,,,,,,,,,324
I'd be happy to be taken as a woman - and that's what I was initially trying to do when I started throwing on dresses and stuff. But that wasn't going to happen because everyone kept calling me sir. So I thought I'd change the method and just start wearing what I wanted to wear.;Eddie Izzard;change                      299,,,,,,,,,324

President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government                      299,,,,,,,,,324

There are ways we can go do a better job of educating young moms and dads about the vital role they have as the child's first teacher.

There are over 200 million illiterate women in India. This low literacy negatively impacts not just their lives but also their families' and the country's economic development.

Well  when you're the youngest of five  parents kind of lose interest more and more through the children.

As children  as we learn what things are  we are slowly learning to dismiss them visually. As adults  entirely submerged in words and concepts  we spend almost all of our time thinking and worrying about the past and the future  hardly ever looking at or engaging with the world visually.;Chris Ware;future                 11,,,,,,,,,325
Just really  really believe in what you're trying to do. Don't let people alter that. Let people advise you and lead you down paths to make smart business decisions.

Nevertheless  there is another threat on the horizon. I see this threat in environmentalism which is becoming a new dominant ideology  if not a religion. Its main weapon is raising the alarm and predicting the human life endangering climate change based on man-made global warming.;Vaclav Klaus;religion                    12,,,,,,,,,325
I love the game  it's the greatest game on earth  that's why I can't understand all of this talk about trying to make the game better. People talk about the high strike zone and changing this and that. Why? To speed up the game? That's the beauty of baseball.

At her birthday  my seven-year-old daughter will say that she wants these big cakes and certain expensive toys as presents  and I can't say no to her. It would just break my heart.

I was 21 in 1968  so I'm as much a child of the '60s as is possible to be. In those years the subject of religion had really almost disappeared the idea that religion was going to be a major force in the life of our societies  in the West anyway  would have seemed absurd in 1968.;Salman Rushdie;religion                   16,,,,,,,,,325
The pop world is cool  but I never really thought of myself as part of it or wanting to be a part of it because I'm on a label that's not really like that.

If you know how to read  you have a complete education about life  then you know how to vote within a democracy. But if you don't know how to read  you don't know how to decide.

When I was a little kid  all I wanted to do was to escape what I thought was the country and get to a city.

As far as friendships go  things change even without the fame. People start moving on.

Music videos are notoriously long  not fun  grueling. You are known there as a dancer and it's kind of sad because dancers  in a lot of ways  are under-appreciated and kind of under-respected when it come to that so they don't necessarily treat you in a nice way when you do a music video.;Jenna Dewan;sad                  33,,,,,,,,,325

Everyone has their own insecurities  regardless of how you look or how people perceive you  but sometimes people give their insecurities too much power. Defining beauty is simply a matter of opinion.

Even before he came to power in 1997  Gordon Brown promised to change the accounts to parliament from simple litanies of cash in and cash out  to a more commercial system that took notice of the public property the departments were using.

Some of us are interested in directors  but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors.

The people and the mindset that killed 3 000 of our fellow citizens on September 11 2001  would have killed not 3 0  but 300 000 if they could have or 3 million or 30 million.

Short fiction is the medium I love the most  because it requires that I bring everything I've learned about poetry - the concision  the ability to say something as vividly as possible - but also the ability to create a narrative that  though lacking a novel's length  satisfies the reader.;Ron Rash;poetry                  43,,,,,,,,,325
My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier  a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful.

Unlike some of the time-travel movies I love  like 'Primer' or '12 Monkeys ' 'Looper' is not about time travel. It's about this situation that time travel creates and the people dealing with that situation.

My focus is always on the day. What I've done behind me  I try to have respect for it  and keep an eye on it  and make sure it isn't abused  and obviously be thoughtful about it  because it's all real to me.

'Good Morning America' exploited Joan Lunden's pregnancy  but you won't see me bringing my babies on the air.

I love my parents. But I'm almost 28 and it's not fun to be asked  'What are you doing today? What do you want for dinner? When are you going to be home?' It just makes you feel like a kid.

I think it's been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion  and yet the Islamists are evil.

When I was a kid I didn't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn't say it  but  I didn't think anything was funny.

Film and television are just different. Film is cool because it's a complete package. You know the beginning  middle  and end. You can plan it out more  which I like.

I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended.

I've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it's pretty equal. I don't know why that is.

Look  if you have somebody who doesn't have health insurance  who doesn't have a doctor or dentist  and in order to deal with their cold or flu or dental problem  they go to an emergency room - in general  that visit will cost ten times more than walking into a community health center.;Bernie Sanders;health                 4,,,,,,,,,326
I work  and then whenever I have any other time  I'm with my daughter  and then I go to sleep. I think you basically have to abandon the dreams of having any other adult activities in your life.

On one level  nothing's really changed in my life. I still drive my daughter in the car pool on Monday.

As a politician  you have to deal with someone wanting you to fail every day.

I think I meant that  given the circumstances of my childhood  I had the illusion that it's easier to be alone.

After all these years  it's still amazing what Obama is allowed to get away with.

The cardinal sin in sports  what could really wreck it  is not cheating to win  which has gone on forever  but cheating to lose.

It's a great excuse and luxury  having a job and blaming it for your inability to do your own art.

I don't have a fear factor. Well  not much of one. And I'm willing to risk quite a lot - as a comedian  you're always risking a lot.

That is quite a risky business.;David Walliams;failure                   32,,,,,,,,,326
If we didn't want to upset anyone  we would make films about sewing  but even that could be dangerous. But I think finally  in a film  it is how the balance is and the feelings are.

My dad was a huge country music fan  but he also had a band and he sang. So he'd listen to a lot of music and the songs that he'd learn for the band were more from the male artists.

I say the law should be blind to race  gender and sexual orientation  just as it claims to be blind to wealth and power.

When we were filming 'The Darkest Hour ' we didn't even know what the aliens were going to look like  we didn't even have a graphic reference.

A human being has so many skins inside  covering the depths of the heart. We know so many things  but we don't know ourselves!

It is important for women to have a choice  to have an opportunity to plan their families  because if they don't  the Republicans have said this is an ownership society.

I've been in and out of Wall Street since 1949  and I've never seen the type of animosity between government and Wall Street.

I was a huge fan of comedy and movies and TV growing up  and I was able to memorize and mimic a lot of things  not realizing that that meant I probably wanted to be an actor.

I guess as long as people think of me for different ages  I'll trust their opinion. I remember noticing one year that Michelle Monaghan played 34 and 19  so I've kind of clung to that as my justification that I can be Jake Gyllenhaal's wife and a freshman in college in the same year.;Anna Kendrick;trust                    56,,,,,,,,,326
I think I had kind of an advantage. When I was growing up  my dad had just got out of jail and he had a great record collection. He had - it was all - these were the songs.

But the war on terror as I have repeatedly said in the past  and the Afghan people believe in it  in truth  is that the war on terror is not in the Afghan villages or homes.

There's this index that tallies up how much your movies have made  and if they haven't grossed a certain amount  then you're not bankable.

I've never had a very quiet voice. I tried in choir to make it smaller  and it just didn't work out. And I listened to a lot of soul music when I was growing up on my own accord.

There comes a point in your moviegoing life where you look at the screen and then you look at the world and you ask  'What is going on?'

Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or  not feel.

It's cool  it's actually really neat.;Avril Lavigne;change                     253,,,,,,,,,326
I'm not convinced that women have the education or the sense of their own history enough or that they understand the cruelty of which men are capable and the delight that many men will take in seeing you choose to chain yourself - then they get to say 'See  you did it yourself.';Alice Walker;education                     256,,,,,,,,,326
Life expectancy in many parts of Africa can be something around the age of thirty five to thirty eight. I mean you're very fortunate if you live to that age. In fact when I went to Uganda for the first time one of the things that occurred to me was that I saw very few elderly people.;Annie Lennox;age                      301,,,,,,,,,326
Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.;Yuri Milner;amazing                      301,,,,,,,,,326
Politicians also have a love affair with the 'small business exemption.' Too much paperwork? Too heavy a burden? Not enough time? Just exempt small businesses from the rule. It sounds so pro-growth. Instead it's an admission that the costs of a regulation just can't be justified.;John Sununu;business                      301,,,,,,,,,326
People and squirrels are very different. Most people will not argue that. But I find that there is one situation in which they're very similar. And that is: when I am driving towards them in my car. Then they're kind of hard to tell apart - especially if the human is kind of hairy.;Demetri Martin;car                      301,,,,,,,,,326
One of the matters that must be addressed is that Rwanda and Uganda have to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We're also supporting processes to ensure that the political dialogue among the Congolese themselves takes place so that the people there can decide their future.;Thabo Mbeki;future                      301,,,,,,,,,326
But it's much more exciting to make Die Hard. One of the reasons that I think that movie is so successful is it deals with those very important blue-collar relationship themes. But it's more visually beautiful to show things blowing up. It just gives you more on the screen.;Penn Jillette;relationship                      301,,,,,,,,,326
The territorial state is such an ancient form of society - here in Europe it dates back thousands of years - that it is now protected by the sanctity of age and the glory of tradition. A strong religious feeling mingles with the respect and the devotion to the fatherland.;Christian Lous Lange;respect                      301,,,,,,,,,326

Clearly  if it is sensible to hold a referendum on independence  it is crucial that we have one on marriage. It is the only way the country can move forward on this issue. Let all those who have a view on this subject place their trust in the Scottish people and let Scotland decide.;Keith O'Brien;marriage                    7,,,,,,,,,327
Culture  what you believe  what you value  how you live matters. Now  as fundamental as these principles are  they may become topics of democratic debates from time to time  so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.;Mitt Romney;relationship                7,,,,,,,,,327
It's odd  because I used to see pictures  on telly or wherever  of what I now know to be Shaftesbury Avenue and I used to wonder what that amazing street with all the lights was. Well  now I know.

But look  I was born in 1956  the peak year for births in US history.

As children  as we learn what things are  we are slowly learning to dismiss them visually. As adults  entirely submerged in words and concepts  we spend almost all of our time thinking and worrying about the past and the future  hardly ever looking at or engaging with the world visually.;Chris Ware;learning                 11,,,,,,,,,327
Looking back  there is nothing wrong with that peace  love and equality that the hippies espoused. In many ways  we have regressed because they were into organic food  back to nature  make love not war  be good to all men  share and share alike - which is what many are talking about now.;Imelda Staunton;peace               12,,,,,,,,,327
The government  for example  has determined that black people (somehow) have fewer abilities than white people  and  so  must be given certain preferences. Anyone acquainted with both black and white people knows this assessment is not only absurd but monstrous. And yet it is the law.;David Mamet;government                 14,,,,,,,,,327
We have over 500 000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona. And we simply cannot sustain it. It costs us a tremendous amount of money of course in health care  in education  and then  on top of it all  in incarceration. And the federal government doesn't reimburse us on any of these things.;Jan Brewer;health                 16,,,,,,,,,327
As you may recall  Truman was extremely unpopular when he finally left Washington in 1953  thanks largely to the Korean War. Today  however  he is thought to have been a solidly good president  a 'Near Great' even  in the terminology of those surveys of historians they do every now and then.;Thomas Frank;war                17,,,,,,,,,327
As far as friendships go  things change even without the fame. People start moving on. I have a few friends that are married and are starting to have kids and I'm like  'Oh my goodness gracious - that's so insane.' I also have friends who are just doing their own thing  which is cool.;Jordin Sparks;change                   24,,,,,,,,,327
Through their own actions  customers can hold companies responsible to higher standards of social responsibility. Through collective action  they can leverage their dollars to combat the force of those investors who myopically pursue profits at the expense of the rest of society.;Simon Mainwaring;society                    25,,,,,,,,,327
When I look at President Obama  I see a leader with a cool head  a caring heart and an open mind  a president who has demonstrated through his demeanor and through his deeds that he is uniquely qualified to heal our divisions  rebuild our nation and lead us to a brighter future together.;Charlie Crist;cool                  30,,,,,,,,,327
In the first book of my Discworld series  published more than 26 years ago  I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times  and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art                   40,,,,,,,,,327
If you're going through friendship issues  I would say  first of all take a step back. How important is the friendship to you? Sometimes  if someone's not being a good friend to you and isn't treating you the way you should be treated  then you kind of have to move on sometimes.;Victoria Justice;friendship                  41,,,,,,,,,327
No matter what message you are about to deliver somewhere  whether it is holding out a hand of friendship  or making clear that you disapprove of something  is the fact that the person sitting across the table is a human being  so the goal is to always establish common ground.;Madeleine Albright;friendship                  57,,,,,,,,,327
If efforts to do social work are couched in selfish motives  then they will die a premature death. Why would my efforts get politicised? I have values I inherited from my father. He helped many.

While we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith  our politics and our culture are  in the main  less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly Christian character than they were even five years ago. I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith                   61,,,,,,,,,327
It is not the end of the physical body that should worry us. Rather  our concern must be to live while we're alive - to release our inner selves from the spiritual death that comes with living behind a facade designed to conform to external definitions of who and what we are.;Elisabeth Kubler-Ross;death                     67,,,,,,,,,327
I don't want to get into the 'who's a hostage-taker' discussion here  but what is the estate tax? It's a double tax on death. Economists will tell you that it's really not a tax that soaks the rich  but it's a tax on capital that deprives business investment and therefore job creation.;Paul Ryan;business                    68,,,,,,,,,327
I think we all have blocks between us and the best version of ourselves  whether it's shyness  insecurity  anxiety  whether it's a physical block  and the story of a person overcoming that block to their best self. It's truly inspiring because I think all of us are engaged in that every day.;Tom Hooper;best                 71,,,,,,,,,327
If you're truly in a band and you guys have been together for a long time  there's a family bond that you have. In fact  I've talked about this with therapists  especially if you're talking about a relationship  because when you're with somebody  you're going to your family  and she's alone.;Gary Allan;alone                73,,,,,,,,,327
We talk a lot on 'Biggest Loser' about how fitness is a natural antidepressant  how it burns off stress. What I like about running is that it gives me time alone. I'm always busy  with people at work  with my kids. I love getting out for a run by myself and just listening to my music.;Alison Sweeney;alone                   78,,,,,,,,,327

We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids' diets from a very early age  which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters.

Giving governors more leeway in administering health care could represent a small  positive development in the ongoing saga of Obamacare. Unfortunately  instead of choosing flexibility  President Obama and his left-leaning advisers always default to rigid 'Washington knows best' answers.;Fred Upton;health                   81,,,,,,,,,327
It is justice and respect that I want the world to dust off and put - without delay  and with tenderness - back on the head of the Palestinian child. It will be imperfect justice and respect because the injustice and disrespect have been so severe. But I believe we are right to try.;Alice Walker;respect                     83,,,,,,,,,327
I was in a really crummy pop-punk band. I think we did a whole bunch of Blink-182 covers  and we were on the fringe of losers and jocks. So we invited all the cool kids to come watch us play in our bass player's brother's bedroom. And it was terrible  but everyone thought we were so cool.;Nate Ruess;cool                    88,,,,,,,,,327
I became a larger than life figure for one reason only. When you're quoted in the 'Wall Street Journal ' the 'New York Times ' constantly as the expert in the business people assume you're a lot bigger than you are. And then I had to run like hell to catch up with my own image.;Barbara Corcoran;business                    102,,,,,,,,,327
I love getting dressed up. Being a pop star is the most brilliant job for that. A lot of girls love shopping  but they might see the most amazing outfit and think  'When am I going to wear that?'  so it's my duty to exploit the fact I do have events I can wear these things to.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;amazing                   108,,,,,,,,,327
I've always believed in God. I also think that's the sort of thing that either comes as part of the equipment  the capacity to believe  or at some point in your life  when you're in a position where you actually need help from a power greater than yourself  you simply make an agreement.;Stephen King;power                  109,,,,,,,,,327
I used to love to draw. I didn't want to go to art class because I felt that would be too corny when I was young  but architectural drafting was the cool thing to do because there was more precision.

'Funny People' is my favorite performance of myself to date. Even though it's a comedy and there are serious moments  I really felt like Leo felt like a real person.

My dear brother Barack Obama has a certain fear of free black men. As a young brother who grows up in a white context  brilliant African father  he's always had to fear being a white man with black skin. All he has known culturally is white. He has a certain rootlessness  a deracination.;Cornel West;fear                   117,,,,,,,,,327
The Jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world.

Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness  and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.;Hans Urs von Balthasar;beauty                     119,,,,,,,,,327
Our Founders warned against this. They said don't... that your liberty is only as secure as the people are.

I know this president. And I can tell you that he cares deeply about the next generation of young women in this country - his daughters  and everyone's daughters.

There's not a lot of room anymore for what I call 'made-up' drama. The drama comes from real places now - marriage takes work and focus  the kid stuff takes patience and commitment.

I hope that I'm sexy in a different kind of way than I think that a lot of girls are right now.

The Bible tells us that God will meet all our needs. He feeds the birds of the air and clothes the grass with the splendor of lilies.

Common sense tells us that the government's attempts to solve large problems more often create new ones. Common sense also tells us that a top-down  one-size-fits-all plan will not improve the workings of a nationwide health-care system that accounts for one-sixth of our economy.;Sarah Palin;government                     147,,,,,,,,,327
The Arab League tells us to go in and take out Qaddafi. We've spent billions of dollars already with respect to the Arab League. Billions of dollars  because they told us to do it.

President Obama clearly cannot run on his record. All he's offering is more of the same. That's not good. Look at the economy. It's stagnating.

We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic  multi-faith society.

When I look back at those pictures of my mother performing - and listen to her recordings - it makes me sad to think that all of that joy she found in her work came to an end.

Since the departure of good old-fashioned entertainers the re-emergence of somebody who wants to be an entertainer has unfortunately become a synonym for camp.

There's a hardening of the culture. Reality TV has lowered the standards of entertainment. You're left wondering about the legitimacy of relationships.

The reason that minorities and women don't have a better shot at getting elected to the Senate or to statewide office is because the campaign finance rules are so skewed as to make it very difficult for non-traditional candidates to raise the money necessary to get elected.;Carol Moseley Braun;finance                      302,,,,,,,,,327
I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship.

There is nothing like the way people feel after they've seen 'The Intouchables.' They feel amazing. The word of mouth on this film is incredible. It's intelligent-feeling good.

Comedy can be  especially in a writer's room  really aggressive  kind of a very male-dominated room  and it would be hard for women. It's not a nurturing place.

A lot of women these days  a lot of young women don't want to call themselves feminists.

I like the idea of dating  but I'm not dating anyone exclusively  particularly right now. It's hard to be in a relationship unless you're ready to go public with it.

When we talk about Oscars  it's almost as a symbol of excellence  and the American public and the worldwide public accept that symbol. So  a movie like 'The Artist' that costs $14 million  has to go out and compete with movies that cost $140 million. How does David deal with Goliath?;Harvey Weinstein;movies                  25,,,,,,,,,328
I had a great drama teacher  and he sort of made out drama school as this incredibly difficult thing to get into: 6 000 people apply every year  and some of the schools only have 12 places. It's a phenomenally difficult thing to get into. And that excited me - I wanted that challenge.;Jeremy Irvine;teacher                   27,,,,,,,,,328
The founders of a new colony  whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project  have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery  and another portion as the site of a prison.;Nathaniel Hawthorne;happiness                   28,,,,,,,,,328
I say the law should be blind to race  gender and sexual orientation  just as it claims to be blind to wealth and power. There should be no specially protected groups of any kind  except for children  the severely disabled and the elderly  whose physical frailty demands society's care.;Camille Paglia;society                 37,,,,,,,,,328
My grandmother was a kind of Scarsdale  New York  society woman  best known in her day as the author of the 1959 book 'Growing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teen-Agers' - this despite being a person whose parenting style made Joan Crawford's wire hangers look like pool noodles.;Sloane Crosley;society                   38,,,,,,,,,328
As far as the leading man/romantic lead  I'll tell you what  I really enjoyed my experience more than I thought or imagined I would on 'Catch and Release.' God bless them if they want to give me another shot at that. I would love to have that as something I can go to on occasion.;Timothy Olyphant;romantic                    39,,,,,,,,,328
I met my grandfather just before he died  and it was the first time that I had seen Dad with a relative of his. It was interesting to see my own father as a son and the body language and alteration in attitude that comes with that  and it sort of changed our relationship for the better.;Christian Bale;dad                    40,,,,,,,,,328
Spirituality does two things for you. One  you are forced to become more selfless  two  you trust to providence. The opposite of a spiritual man is a materialist. If I was a materialist I would be making lots of money doing endorsements  doing cricket commentary. I have no interest in that.;Imran Khan;money                  41,,,,,,,,,328

The Macau casinos have a wonderful business  it's taking in money from Chinese businessmen elsewhere who send it through junky companies to casinos to gamble. The growth continues and they have basically western managers and western accounting  so we trust the numbers a little bit more.;James Chanos;trust                    43,,,,,,,,,328
Every summer my husband and I pack our suitcases  load our kids into the car  and drive from tense  crowded New York City to my family's cottage in Maine. It's on an island  with stretches of sea and sandy beaches  rocky coasts  and pine trees. We barbecue  swim  lie around  and try to do nothing.;Hope Davis;car             48,,,,,,,,,328
I'm sure there were times when I wish I had thought  'Gosh  that might really embarrass mom and dad ' but our parents didn't raise us to think about them. They're very selfless and they wanted us to have as normal of a college life as possible. So really  we didn't think of any repercussions.;Jenna Bush;dad                  51,,,,,,,,,328

I have no idea how to get in touch with anyone anymore. Everyone  it seems  has a home phone  a cell phone  a regular e-mail account  a Facebook account  a Twitter account  and a Web site. Some of them also have a Google Voice number. There are the sentimental few who still have fax machines.;Susan Orlean;home               64,,,,,,,,,328
If you can go out with your live show and turn people on to that  where you have that fan base that's religious and they're going to come see you when you're in that town  once your radio success is gone and you're not a mainstream guy anymore you can still go out and play your shows.;Jason Aldean;success                    64,,,,,,,,,328

Each of us has a very rich nature and can look at things objectively  from a distance  and at the same time can have something more personal to say about them. I am trying to look at the world  and at myself  from many different points of view. I think many poets have this duality.;Wislawa Szymborska;nature                  68,,,,,,,,,328
Acceptable food rots while we are chased from bins behind restaurants  chased from sleeping on the street  chased from relieving ourselves unless we pay for food or gas  until finally we are so hungry  sleepless  smelly  constipated and beaten-down that we simply die of lack of will to live.;Jane Siberry;food                69,,,,,,,,,328
I look at my father. He is one of my heroes. He is such an incredible  classy man. He was such a great father and such a great husband in so many ways  and we lived through some pretty tough times losing my mom. When I see all that he did  I think  'Wow  that's a really wonderful man.';Emmanuelle Chriqui;mom                 69,,,,,,,,,328
Many differences are rooted in biology and reinforced through culture  so it's important to acknowledge that. Because if you say men and women are the same and if male behaviour is the norm  and women are always expected to act like men  we will never be as good at being men as men are.;Dee Dee Myers;women                   69,,,,,,,,,328
But I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language  his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded  but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.;Chinua Achebe;poetry                    74,,,,,,,,,328
I love Rauschenberg. I love that he created a turning point in visual history  that he redefined the idea of beauty  that he combined painting  sculpture  photography  and everyday life with such gall  and that he was interested in  as he put it  'the ability to conceive failure as progress.';Jerry Saltz;beauty              77,,,,,,,,,328
I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library  and it's better than college. People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money. At the end of 10 years  I had read every book in the library and I'd written a thousand stories.;Ray Bradbury;money                    77,,,,,,,,,328
I stayed in Baghdad every summer until I was 14. My dad's sister is still there  but many of my relatives have managed to get out.

'Hamlet' is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper. All the big  unknowable questions like what it is to be a human being the difference between sanity and insanity the meaning of life and death what's real and not real. All these subjects can literally drive you mad.;Michael Sheen;death                     80,,,,,,,,,328
I think it's been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion  and yet the Islamists are evil. Those of us who have had experience with Islam understand this  just as we understand the difference between snake handlers and people going to church on Sunday morning.;P. J.

We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids' diets from a very early age  which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters. We don't buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit  yogurt  raw almonds  or dried whole grain cereals for snack time.;Cat Cora;food                  81,,,,,,,,,328
I had so many offers after 'True Blood' for things that were someone in the same vein  but nowhere near Alan Ball's vision. Or something that was over-the-top and fantastical. And I've always wanted to play the regular  working-class mom  and I've never really had the chance to do that.;Michelle Forbes;mom                   85,,,,,,,,,328
Right now I'd love to be sitting on a Greek island somewhere because of being Greek American  eating great octopus salad and some fantastic lamb. Or sipping a little ouzo. I think the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest... Lots of nuts  vegetables  fruits  fresh fish  lean meats  yogurt.;Cat Cora;diet                92,,,,,,,,,328
I feel like I'm really blessed and lucky that I have a very good social life outside of the gym  and I have a really amazing family. My parents are so supportive.

I think we're getting to the point where everyone's getting fat and everyone's getting allergic  or claims to be allergic to something and people can't walk from their front door to their car without a bottle of water in their hand because they have to hydrate every three and half steps.;Adam Carolla;car                     95,,,,,,,,,328
I believe that the profits will come from the quality of your creative products. Since the beginning  I've always wanted to develop a self-feeding circle of creative productions: the positive financial returns from one show would be used to develop and create a new show  and so on.;Guy Laliberte;positive                    100,,,,,,,,,328
The food in the House of Commons is fairly good. The cafe in Portcullis House is really very high quality  and you also have a choice of eating in the more traditional restaurants  the Churchill Room or the Members' Dining Room. I don't often eat in them  though  as I'm usually on the run.;Vince Cable;food                  105,,,,,,,,,328
You need to put what you learn into practice and do it over and over again until it's a habit. I always say  'Seeing is not believing. Doing is believing.' There is a lot to learn about fitness  nutrition and emotions  but once you do  you can master them instead of them mastering you.;Brett Hoebel;fitness                  107,,,,,,,,,328
The liberals think government exists to fix what's wrong with America. They find fault with our Constitution  our economic model and our core values. We disagree with the premise of their argument. We believe there's nothing wrong with America that an extra dose of freedom won't cure.;Rick Perry;freedom                     108,,,,,,,,,328
My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents  they focused on education  but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music  saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art                   113,,,,,,,,,328
I wouldn't date an actress. There's only room for one actor in my life and I'm it. Too difficult. On the one hand  they understand the job. But on the other hand  it's very competitive within the relationship. Two actors  say one becomes a mega-star and the other doesn't.;Jonathan Rhys Meyers;relationship                   113,,,,,,,,,328
That wasn't the way that things was supposed to be. And all because the so-called culture that I thought was right  that I thought it was cool  and I thought it was fun  and it was exciting at the time. It all led to me laying in a prison bunk by myself with no one to talk to but myself.;Michael Vick;cool                   114,,,,,,,,,328
My mom used to make everything. She had a great garden and composted and made everything from scratch - peanut butter  bread  jelly  everything. I don't know how she did it because all those things take time and love and labour. I only do half the stuff she does - but there's still time.;Julia Roberts;mom                   117,,,,,,,,,328
Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness  and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.;Hans Urs von Balthasar;courage                     119,,,,,,,,,328
The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities  our families  our faiths.

A lot of people put pressure on themselves and think it will be way too hard for them to live out their dreams. Mentors are there to say  'Look  it's not that tough. It's not as hard as you think.

These women whose antics we smirk at good-naturedly in the pap-traps put themselves out there at least partly on their beauty they are in showbiz  and showing what they've got is part of their business as much as it is for male show-ponies from the Chippendales to George Clooney.;Julie Burchill;business                     145,,,,,,,,,328
President Obama clearly cannot run on his record. All he's offering is more of the same. That's not good. Look at the economy. It's stagnating. And so  what they're now going to try and do is bring this campaign down to little things  distractions  distortions  smear  fear  anger  frustration.;Paul Ryan;anger               150,,,,,,,,,328
It's not hard to get your way when it's your way or the highway. People either follow suit or they're not around. I don't really like the sound of that  'cause that sounds like a temper tantrum.

Acting is something I love. It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career. In my life  I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me.;Hugh Jackman;hope                     183,,,,,,,,,328
The Iranian regime suppresses its own people as well as others in the region. It prevents peace by sponsoring terror globally.

Today's preoccupation with physical theories of everything takes a wrong turn from the purpose of science - to question all things relentlessly.

And it's absolutely true that male sexual behaviour and female responses to male demands change a lot when they start communicating - and the levels of the communication that I've seen on the ground in very  very poor areas are so high and I think why don't we have that here?;Emma Thompson;communication                     206,,,,,,,,,328
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture  so that Africa is not a net importer of food  but an exporter of food.;Gordon Brown;relationship                    207,,,,,,,,,328
I was very restless. I really wanted to be a part of a kind of a progressive society. I was fed up with these Communist doctrines and you were hassled all the time with members of the Party committee who were KGB  what you have to do  where in the West you can go or not to go.;Mikhail Baryshnikov;society                    212,,,,,,,,,328
I want the government to provide the military so we don't get invaded by somebody and destroyed. I want the government to provide the roads so I can get from point A to B. In terms of taking care of my day to day needs  I want to do that myself. I want my community to do that.;Benjamin Carson;government                     218,,,,,,,,,328
The whole kiss-and-tell thing is a negative approach that often happens in a World Cup. We will see negative stories about the players and it can affect their confidence and the overall performance of the national team on the pitch  let alone the bid to actually stage the competition.;Gary Lineker;alone                     231,,,,,,,,,328
I feel sorry... for people who've had skinny privilege and then have it taken away from them. I have had a lifetime to adjust to seeing how people treat women who aren't their idea of beautiful and therefore aren't their idea of useful  and I had to find ways to become useful to myself.;Beth Ditto;women                     235,,,,,,,,,328
Just the actual physical ability to hold four instruments simultaneously and do some of the things that Vivien was able to do is mind blowing to any surgeon.

I'm always told that what I say is controversial. Why is it controversial? Because I speak from a tradition that has now fallen out of favor with the dominant media in this country. And so when I say things like marriage should be between one man and one woman  I'm called a bigot.;Rick Santorum;marriage                     260,,,,,,,,,328
I've noticed that once you leave London you do kind of become a bit more famous. People in London are a bit too cool for school. It's not so unusual to see someone from London in the street. But outside of London people are a bit more excited to see you and come out and support you.;David Walliams;cool                      303,,,,,,,,,328
There are over 200 million illiterate women in India. This low literacy negatively impacts not just their lives but also their families' and the country's economic development.

The U.K. needs a system for family migration underpinned by three simple principles. One: that those who come here should do so on the basis of a genuine relationship. Two: that migrants should be able to pay their way. And three: that they are able to integrate into British society.;Theresa May;family                      303,,,,,,,,,328
They taught us because they wanted to pass the knowledge on and educate young musicians. It was not because they had to teach because they failed as musicians. There is a huge difference in the reasons why someone is teaching and what they can offer and what they cannot offer.;Miroslav Vitous;knowledge                      303,,,,,,,,,328
My sense of religion is Einstein's sense of relativity. I don't believe in God. I believe that energy never dies.

Ten years ago U.S. defence investment represented almost half of all defence expenditure in the whole alliance. Today it is 75%.

Oh  I think there are a lot of people who would be buying and selling online today that go up there and they get the information  but then when it comes time to type in their credit card they think twice because they're not sure about how that might get out and what that might mean for them.;Bill Gates;time                    2,,,,,,,,,329
Ooh  it's too embarrassing to share my innermost romantic secrets - although I have written Danielle the odd poem. If anything they are more comedic than romantic. They used to be well-received but that was before she started studying Shakespeare at drama college. Now I feel so inept.;Gary Lineker;romantic                     3,,,,,,,,,329
For me  it's about the way I carry myself and the way I treat other people. My relationship and how I feel about God and what He does for me  is something deeply personal.

With 'Twilight ' you have these massive tomes that you have to condense. With 'Penoza ' we had an eight episode Dutch series that  just for the pilot alone  I condensed three episodes.

To become self-aware  people must be allowed to hear a plurality of opinions and then make up their own minds. They must be allowed to say  write and publish whatever they want. Freedom of expression is the most basic  but fundamental  right. Without it  human beings are reduced to automatons.;Ma Jian;freedom                 20,,,,,,,,,329
I think I meant that  given the circumstances of my childhood  I had the illusion that it's easier to be alone. To have your relationships be casual and also to pose as a solitary person  because it was more romantic. You know  I was raised on the idea of the ramblin' man and the loner.;Steve Martin;romantic                  20,,,,,,,,,329
Some people want fame  popularity and huge sales. I've always hoped to have a really long career. So I've tried to make each of my creative decisions and business decisions to allow for longevity. As a side effect I got really famous and really big. I didn't realize the two could go together.;Jewel;famous                     21,,,,,,,,,329
As far as friendships go  things change even without the fame. People start moving on. I have a few friends that are married and are starting to have kids and I'm like  'Oh my goodness gracious - that's so insane.'

The type of cuisine I do  especially after being on 'Iron Chef' for several years  is a lot of global cuisine.

A lot of women these days  a lot of young women don't want to call themselves feminists. You have this cheap  hideous 'girl power' sort of fad  which I think is pretty benign at best  but at worst  I think it's a way of taking the politics out of feminism and making it some kind of fashion.;Ani DiFranco;power                 25,,,,,,,,,329

I never wore a tie voluntarily  even though I was forced to wear one for photos when I was young and for official events at school. I used to wrap my tie in a newspaper  and whenever the teacher checked I would quickly put it on again. I'm not used to it.

I feel there's a power in theatre  but it's an indirect power. It's like the relationship of the sleeper to the unconscious. You discover things you can't afford to countenance in waking life.

In the first book of my Discworld series  published more than 26 years ago  I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times  and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;death                   40,,,,,,,,,329
It has never made any sense to argue that  unique among the people of the world  Arabs are more concerned on a day-to-day basis about the treatment of people they don't know than they are about how they're going to put food on their own tables  or whether their sons will ever find a job.;John Podhoretz;food                   41,,,,,,,,,329
Leon Theremin's original designs are elegant  ingenious and effective. As electronics goes  the theremin is very simple. But there are so many subtleties hidden in the details of the design. It's like a great sonnet  or a painting  or a speech  that is perfectly done on more than one level.;Robert Moog;design                 44,,,,,,,,,329
My role in 'Legally Blonde' was really rewarding  because I had so much fun working on the movie. I've had really rewarding experiences on tiny low budget films that you'll never see but where I had a cool time creating characters as well. I love almost all of the characters I've played.;Alanna Ubach;cool                     48,,,,,,,,,329
Whether they run a record company or a grocery store  every boss will tell you you're in big trouble if you're borrowing more than you can ever afford to pay back. Delaying the pain for future generations is suicidal. We've got to start getting the deficit down right now  not next year.;Simon Cowell;future                    52,,,,,,,,,329
What I fell in love with as a child was 'My Fair Lady ' 'Funny Face ' 'American in Paris ' and 'Singin' in the Rain.' Just perfect movies to me and I was dancing. I started ballet when I was three. And I fell in love with those movies and fell in love with Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron.;Dianna Agron;funny                   53,,,,,,,,,329
I could play it safe by recording songs that are familiar  but am I expanding myself as an artist by doing covers? It's a catch-22. It's called show business: The word 'business' is in it  and you've got to be a businessman. But then again  you have to be true to yourself as an artist.;Donny Osmond;business                   57,,,,,,,,,329
I think we're the only jokeless show on television. I mean really  we have no setups and no punch lines. It's not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.;Rainn Wilson;experience                     65,,,,,,,,,329
We are persuaded that good Christians will always be good citizens  and that where righteousness prevails among individuals the Nation will be great and happy.

There are a lot of things that are personally uncomfortable to show  especially me without makeup and completely bloated or crying. But I've realized that it's time for me to show my audience that you don't have to be perfect to achieve your dreams. Because nobody relates to being perfect.;Katy Perry;time                     67,,,,,,,,,329
I'm somebody who doesn't work with a stylist. I'll be honest with you  I'm a mom and it's just not something I want to put money toward because it's expensive to have somebody who helps dress you and I feel like I have to pay for preschool and so many things... so I don't have a stylist.;Busy Philipps;mom                     69,,,,,,,,,329
So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know  if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one  which it wasn't in - 21 years ago  then I'd think  well  you know  maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.;Richard Branson;learning                71,,,,,,,,,329
There is this concept of politics as a dirty game. It's a difficult game  but it doesn't have to be dirty. I think this is what we need to bring to politics. I think politics around the world has very often been captured by big interests - 'lobbies' they call them in the States.;George Papandreou;politics                     72,,,,,,,,,329
If you're working out in front of a mirror and watching your muscles grow  your ego has reached a point where it is now eating itself. That's why I believe there should be a psychiatrist at every health club  so that when they see you doing this  they will take you away for a little chat.;Lewis Black;health                   73,,,,,,,,,329
It's hard for women who make a lot of money and make decisions all day long  then they have to come home and be 'Stupid Sally.' Men need respect  and they need to know that they can lead in the relationship  so even if they don't make the most money they need to be able to call the shots.;Patti Stanger;home                   75,,,,,,,,,329
I love Rauschenberg.

We talk a lot on 'Biggest Loser' about how fitness is a natural antidepressant  how it burns off stress. What I like about running is that it gives me time alone. I'm always busy  with people at work  with my kids. I love getting out for a run by myself and just listening to my music.;Alison Sweeney;fitness                   78,,,,,,,,,329
Censorship is saying: 'I'm the one who says the last sentence. Whatever you say  the conclusion is mine.' But the internet is like a tree that is growing. The people will always have the last word - even if someone has a very weak  quiet voice. Such power will collapse because of a whisper.;Ai Weiwei;power                    79,,,,,,,,,329
I think it's been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion  and yet the Islamists are evil. Those of us who have had experience with Islam understand this  just as we understand the difference between snake handlers and people going to church on Sunday morning.;P. J. O'Rourke;religion                    80,,,,,,,,,329
Giving governors more leeway in administering health care could represent a small  positive development in the ongoing saga of Obamacare.

I strongly believe that missionaries make better products. They care more. For a missionary  it's not just about the business. There has to be a business  and the business has to make sense  but that's not why you do it.

As long as I am given the opportunity to keep performing and keep exploring in whatever medium  I'll be happy. As long as I get to spend time with my family  I'll be happy.

Giving birth was the most amazing thing I've ever done. I'd been living in a Third World country  and I said  'I'm going to just squat behind a tree.' I basically did that but in a chair in my living room. I didn't want a sterile hospital room. I didn't want doctors. I had a midwife.;Carolyn Murphy;amazing                    96,,,,,,,,,329
The trick at Le Mans is to get the car 'in the window.' Everything is critical: the tyre pressure  the brake temperature  and that means you have to push the car a lot to get it into the window - it's about getting everything to work right and getting the car to flow through the corners.;Tom Kristensen;car                    97,,,,,,,,,329
I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It's embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me  it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally  my body was changing  my mind was changing  and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness.;Keanu Reeves;funny                  105,,,,,,,,,329
This is the great thing about Northern Ireland. I walk down the street and people stop me and say things like  'I know you. You're that wee golfer  aren't you?' I say  'Yeah  that's me.'

A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect  and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.

PETA's campaign should be included in school curricula. If we can open children's hearts and minds to animals' needs  teach them to treat a dog or a chicken as if they feel fear and love and pain - as they do - then they will grow up to understand that we are all worthy of respect.;Ingrid Newkirk;respect                     116,,,,,,,,,329
A permanent base on Mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology.

Today I can announce a raft of reforms that we estimate could save over 2.5 million police hours every year. That's the equivalent of more than 1 200 police officer posts.

We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people  of every background  to succeed and prosper.

What we see today is an American economy that has boomed because of policies and developments of the 1950s and '60s: the interstate-highway system  massive funding for science and technology  a public-education system that was the envy of the world and generous immigration policies.;Fareed Zakaria;science                    146,,,,,,,,,329
I've never had a relationship with a record executive. I always went to the record company by someone that liked my playing. Then they would get fired  and I'd be left with the record company.

People more than ever since I can remember are concerned about being out of step and out of line with their political party and won't cross over.

It would be great to do another television show that was a multi-camera because the hours are so wonderful and you can be a good mom at the same time.

Most modern science fiction went to school on 'Dune.' Even 'Harry Potter' with its 'boy protagonist who has not yet grown into his destiny' shares a common theme.

I hate organized religion. I think you have to love thy neighbor as thyself. I think you have to pick your own God and be true to him. I always say 'him' rather than 'her.'

I'm not in the business of becoming famous. And that's the advice I give to younger aspiring actors. Work onstage and do the little roles. In the end it's not important to be seen.

There is nothing like the way people feel after they've seen 'The Intouchables.' They feel amazing. The word of mouth on this film is incredible. It's intelligent-feeling good.

I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship.

I think every religious person should have a deep sense of respect for other people's religious documents and religious symbols just as we were deeply opposed to the Taliban destroying the two historic buddhas which they blew up.

Studios  because they are investing a great deal of money in movies  they want a guarantee that when they hire somebody that person can deliver for them.

Actually  music gave me the support when I needed it. I would never have gone to college unless I'd gotten a piano scholarship.

With fame  you can't trust everybody. You can't depend on them being there for you as a person. They will only be there because of what you've got you as a person.

As an actor  there is room for a certain amount of creativity  but you're always ultimately going to be saying somebody else's words.

We have over 500 000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona. And we simply cannot sustain it.

In a very weak economy  when you say 'cut government spending ' what you mean is you're laying off school teachers and you're de-funding various programs that put money into the economy.

Swedes are such a civilised  perfect society - at least on the surface. There's a great safety net  a huge middle class  free education  free health care.

I've always loved 3D. In fact  as a kid  I was exposed to 3D at an early age because my grandfather was a specialist of 3D in cinematheques.

In the traditional urban novel  there is only survival or not.

I've always been attracted to cars  and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid  you're the slowest  and if you qualify first on the grid  you're the fastest.

While a case can be made for intelligent design  I can't figure out why some Christians are so thrilled about that possibility. First of all  it doesn't prove there's a God.

Our criminal justice system is fallible. We know it  even though we don't like to admit it. It is fallible despite the best efforts of most within it to do justice.

And I think the more money you put in people's hands  the more they will spend. And if they don't spend it  they invest it. And investing it is another way of creating jobs. It puts money into mutual funds or other kinds of banks that can go out and make loans  and we need to do that.;Michael Bloomberg;money                   52,,,,,,,,,330
If we can't have the courage to tell our constituents  hey  we've got to cut back  then if we can point to something and say  I would like to vote for more benefits for you  but this balanced budget amendment or statutory spending cap or whatever the device is  is preventing me from doing it.;Jeff Flake;courage                53,,,,,,,,,330

Yes I have made a lot of money and I have a lot of respect  my films have done well  and I know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me.

If we do not change our negative habits toward climate change  we can count on worldwide disruptions in food production  resulting in mass migration  refugee crises and increased conflict over scarce natural resources like water and farm land.

While we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith  our politics and our culture are  in the main  less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly Christian character than they were even five years ago.

Your kids can say some cruel things to you at times. For example  Nicole  Miles and Sofie are standing there in the room and I'm dressed to kill in my own mind. They'll say to me  'Dad  you're not going out there looking like that are you?' If that doesn't kill a star  I don't know what does!;Lionel Richie;dad                 64,,,,,,,,,330
My mom can't defend herself to the world. She is such an amazing woman  with such an open heart. It's a real hard line  and I crossed it. I took everyone's life story and assumed it would be a great thing to put on screen. I was being selfish and I feel so horrible about it. I feel so guilty.;Nikki Reed;mom                    70,,,,,,,,,330
The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox  when there's a single numeric average.

Brits and Americans have hundreds of different phrases for the same thing. Luckily  it's usually a source of amusement rather than frustration. A flashlight by any other name is still a torch.

The lips on my upper right bicep are my girlfriend's lips.

I think it can be hard for any man to sometimes be upstaged by his wife. So when I'm home  I work very hard to be Todd's wife and Jade's mother.

You've got to set yourself up to be as healthy as you can. The thing we tend to do is when it gets to be a bit too hard  we actually opt out for the absolute worst option.

Part of what I loved - and love - about being around older people is the tangible sense of history they embody.

I'm interested in writing because one of those grandfathers wrote books.;Jon Meacham;history                    146,,,,,,,,,330
The Bible tells us that God will meet all our needs. He feeds the birds of the air and clothes the grass with the splendor of lilies.

I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route  so I had friends in all areas.

President Obama called for a 'we' nation in his Inauguration Address. Art convenes. It is not just inspirational. It is aspirational.

Most modern science fiction went to school on 'Dune.' Even 'Harry Potter' with its 'boy protagonist who has not yet grown into his destiny' shares a common theme.

I think one of my favorite things to do is just lock myself up in a small room and listen to music and watch films for a day. Also I just like seeing my friends.

I've noticed that once you leave London you do kind of become a bit more famous. People in London are a bit too cool for school. It's not so unusual to see someone from London in the street.

You need to look the part for your sponsors  you need to be able to speak the part for the media and to big CEOs.;Danica Patrick;age                   114,,,,,,,,,331
Driving a motorcycle is like flying. All your senses are alive. When I ride through Beverly Hills in the early morning  and all the sprinklers have turned off  the scents that wash over me are just heavenly. Being House is like flying  too.

I wanted to be an English teacher. I wanted to do it for the corduroy jackets with patches on the side. When I got to college  as I was walking across campus one day  I ripped off a little flyer for this sketch-comedy group.

Bill Clinton sitting on Air Force One getting his hair cut while people around the country cooled their heels and waited for him  became a metaphor for a populist president who had gotten drunk with the perks of his own power and was sort of  you know  not sensitive to what people wanted.;Dee Dee Myers;power                   128,,,,,,,,,331
Exercise helps me with stress. It changes your brain chemistry. I turn to Ashtanga yoga when I feel the need to relax. I love it  but it's not right for everybody. It's taught to you a little bit at a time  according to your body type and your strength. That keeps things challenging.;Lisa Edelstein;strength                    128,,,,,,,,,331
I do genuinely believe that the political system is not linear. When it reaches a tipping point fashioned by a critical mass of opinion  the slow pace of change we're used to will no longer be the norm. I see a lot of signs every day that we're moving closer and closer to that tipping point.;Al Gore;change                     135,,,,,,,,,331

I do not want to admit to the world that I can be a bad person. It is just that I don't want anyone to have false expectations.

Pop stardom is not very compelling. I'm much more interested in a relationship between performer and audience that is of equals. I came up through folk music  and there's no pomp and circumstance to the performance.

A great deal has been written in recent years about the purported lack of motivation in the children of the Negro ghettos. Little in my experience supports this  yet the phrase has been repeated endlessly  and the blame in almost all cases is placed somewhere outside the classroom.;Jonathan Kozol;experience                    160,,,,,,,,,331
One thing I've been happy as peach pie about - because I'm all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home - is that nannies  day cares and babysitters are all collapsing  which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home.;Laura Schlessinger;home                    173,,,,,,,,,331
Acting is something I love. It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career. In my life  I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me.;Hugh Jackman;respect                     183,,,,,,,,,331
I don't want to clip on the armour every morning. I've seen some politicians do this and they get a bit mangled and bitter. I just refuse to do that.

I'm pretty horrible at relationships and haven't been in many long-term ones.

Well  it's a little harder in New York. It's not as forgiving to a film crew. You hold up a bunch of New Yorkers who can't cross the street  they're not going to take it well. Southern California?

Somehow  the greater the public opposition to the health care bill  the more determined they seem to force it on us anyway.

Studios  because they are investing a great deal of money in movies  they want a guarantee that when they hire somebody that person can deliver for them.

I've created  directed and choreographed for Lady Gaga since the beginning  so 'Born This Way ' this was musically such an amazing evolution and such a brilliant record.

I was a dancer  and it's not really cool for a boy to dance  so it was inspiring to see a movie like 'Footloose' where a guy is dancing masculine and had a proper reason behind it. It made me feel cool  and when these kids would make fun of me  I'd be like  'Oh  didn't you see 'Footloose ' man?';Kenny Wormald;cool               14,,,,,,,,,332
In this business  if you take too long  the landscape changes. So the opportunities that were there when I decided to take a break weren't there when I came back.

Increased revenues  meaning higher taxes  will be a central element of any successful long-term budget plan  and President Obama is right to insist that the wealthy - the slice of America that has come through the recession in by far the best financial health - should provide those funds.;Steven Rattner;health                   18,,,,,,,,,332
When I hit a block  regardless of what I am writing  what the subject matter is  or what's going on in the plot  I go back and I read Pablo Neruda's poetry.

For 'So Cold the River ' I'm actually working on adapting the book with Scott Silver  who was just nominated for an Oscar for 'The Fighter ' and who also wrote '8 Mile ' which I think is a terrific screenplay.

A lot of women these days  a lot of young women don't want to call themselves feminists. You have this cheap  hideous 'girl power' sort of fad  which I think is pretty benign at best  but at worst  I think it's a way of taking the politics out of feminism and making it some kind of fashion.;Ani DiFranco;politics                 25,,,,,,,,,332
I thought if anyone need a leg up  it was our foster children. So  I started getting involved in education reform  and that was back in 1998.

I did  I was there for six years.;Michele Bachmann;education                 33,,,,,,,,,332
Two weeks ago at the U.S. Amateur  my mom caddied  and that is kind of a different feeling  because she's your mom and you have to listen to her.

It was my duty to shoot the enemy  and I don't regret it. My regrets are for the people I couldn't save: Marines  soldiers  buddies. I'm not naive  and I don't romanticize war.

In order to have good fried chicken  you should wash and season the bird the morning you're preparing it for dinner. Don't wait and do it right before you start cooking.

Owners of dogs will have noticed that  if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection  they will think you are God.

If I don't feel confident about my body  I'm not going to sit at home and feel sorry for myself and not do something about it. It's all about taking action and not being lazy.

My political ideas and things like that  even my religion  I try to keep close to me because it's a personal thing  and I don't shove it down people's throats.

Jews have a special relationship to books  and the Haggadah has been translated more widely  and reprinted more often  than any other Jewish book.

If a person is homosexual by nature - that is  if one's sexuality is as intrinsic a part of one's identity as gender or skin color - then society can no more deny a gay person access to the secular rights and religious sacraments because of his homosexuality than it can reinstate Jim Crow.;Jon Meacham;nature                     45,,,,,,,,,332
Competition makes things come out right. Well  what does that mean in health care? More hospitals so they compete with each other. More doctors compete with each other. More pharmaceutical companies.

The whole point of being in the Army is wanting to get killed  wanting to test yourself to the limits. Now you have to fly 15 000ft above the war zone to avoid getting hit.

I was taught that to create anything you had to believe in failure  simply because you had to be prepared to go through an idea without any fear.

The thing about being at home versus being out in the world working is  it's a whole different vibe. When I'm home with my kids and partner  I will cook - even though she's a very good cook.

It's hard for women who make a lot of money and make decisions all day long  then they have to come home and be 'Stupid Sally.'

I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library  and it's better than college. People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money.

It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers ' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then.

The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer's journey  shifts the emphasis from process to product  and lacks individuality and openness.

Effective therapy begins with the acceptance of the therapist into the client's quality world.;William Glasser;humor                      307,,,,,,,,,332
What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing. I learned something from all those sets and reps when I didn't think I could lift another ounce of weight. What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know.;Arnold Schwarzenegger;learning                      307,,,,,,,,,332
A lot of people over time have had this kind of pattern in their relationship with Bill Clinton. You first meet him and you're overwhelmed by his talent. He's so energetic and articulate and full of ideas and he calls himself a congenital optimist and that optimism is contagious.;Dee Dee Myers;relationship                      307,,,,,,,,,332
See  that's why Barack's running: to end the war in Iraq responsibly - to build an economy that lifts every family  to make sure health care is available for every American - and to make sure that every child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college.;Michelle Obama;family                    3,,,,,,,,,333

My first car  I got it in an auction at my temple. It was an '86 Volvo that I got for 500 bucks  and then wound up throwing $10 000 into the stereo system and put TVs in the foot rests. It was the most ridiculous Volvo you'd ever seen  but I had never had money before and I was out of my mind.;Shia LaBeouf;money                  12,,,,,,,,,333
There are times  like after a long day of work  when the thought of an easy drive-through is enticing. But then I remember how crappy I felt when I ate fast food in the past  and it inspires me to head to the grocery store or my local farmer's market and whip up an easy but healthier option.;Alison Sweeney;food                   15,,,,,,,,,333
When you're a kid  I think you want to be a film star. And I'm not as enamoured with that any more. The reality of that life is a lot of travel  and a lot of being away  which is impractical because I have four children  so I don't want to be away that much  not the other side of the world away.;Rob Brydon;travel                 17,,,,,,,,,333
When you're a chef  you graze. You never get a chance to sit down and eat. They don't actually sit down and eat before you cook. So when I finish work  the first thing I'll do  and especially when I'm in New York  I'll go for a run. And I'll run 10 or 15k on my - and I run to gain my appetite.;Gordon Ramsay;work                  18,,,,,,,,,333
My generation of bossy  confident  baby-boom women were something brand new in history. Our energy and assertiveness weren't created by Betty Friedan  unknown before her 1963 book  or by Gloria Steinem  whose political activism  as even the Lifetime profile admitted  did not begin until 1969.;Camille Paglia;history               22,,,,,,,,,333
Just as we reject racism  sexism  ageism  and heterosexism  we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race  sex  age  or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans.;Gary L.

After my second-to-last record  'The Greatest'  I had gone on tour for a while  and I didn't play an instrument for about five years. And I got kind of - it's not self-esteem or whatever  or anger toward myself - but disappointed in myself that I hadn't been challenging myself to learn musically.;Cat Power;anger                  30,,,,,,,,,333
For all my years in public life  I have believed that America must sail toward the shores of liberty and justice for all. There is no end to that journey  only the next great voyage.

I don't watch the movies I make  so I haven't seen 'Footloose' since it came out. You see this young  hungry actor  it's pretty fun. I was the only one they screen tested. It was an attempt by the director and producer to talk the head of the studio into hiring me because they didn't want me.;Kevin Bacon;movies                   31,,,,,,,,,333
When I meet gay fans out and about  they're so great to talk to - and I'm big on hugging  because I'm from the Midwest. They're just so energetic and loving. I'm proud to have those fans  and their support means a lot to me. I don't want just girls coming to my movies I want guys to come  too!;Kellan Lutz;movies                  34,,,,,,,,,333
My parents had an arranged marriage  as did so many other people when I was growing up. My father came and had a life in the United States one way and my mother had a different one  and I was very aware of those things.

Owners of dogs will have noticed that  if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection  they will think you are God.

I met my grandfather just before he died  and it was the first time that I had seen Dad with a relative of his. It was interesting to see my own father as a son and the body language and alteration in attitude that comes with that  and it sort of changed our relationship for the better.;Christian Bale;attitude                    40,,,,,,,,,333
People come up to me all the time and say  'Oh  I love to watch Food Network ' and I ask them what they cook  and they say  'I don't really cook.' They're afraid  they're intimidated  they know all about food from eating out and watching TV  but they don't know where to start in their own kitchen.;Michael Symon;food              41,,,,,,,,,333
When I design and wonder what the point is  I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So  in that sense  fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little.;Miuccia Prada;sad                   42,,,,,,,,,333
If a person is homosexual by nature - that is  if one's sexuality is as intrinsic a part of one's identity as gender or skin color - then society can no more deny a gay person access to the secular rights and religious sacraments because of his homosexuality than it can reinstate Jim Crow.;Jon Meacham;society                     45,,,,,,,,,333
All that stuff about heavy metal and hard rock  I don't subscribe to any of that. It's all just music. I mean  the heavy metal from the '70s sounds nothing like the stuff from the '80s  and that sounds nothing like the stuff from the '90s. Who's to say what is and isn't a certain type of music?;Neil Young;music                   46,,,,,,,,,333
'The Food Network' was just starting in New York  and I was getting lots of attention from Mesa Grill. They had no money  so if you couldn't get there by subway  you couldn't be on. It wasn't like TV was something I really wanted to do - but I knew it would be great publicity for my restaurants.;Bobby Flay;food                   48,,,,,,,,,333
I recently spent quite a bit of time in Sheffield  England  which is where I'm from. I wouldn't move back there  but it's funny when you spend a bit of time in the place where you were brought up.

I'd love to be an artist that's multifaceted. At the moment  I am not. But wouldn't that be cool if I was like  'Yeah  let me pull out my guitar and play you a song.' I would adore that. I am so far not gifted in that way. But I am a very hard worker and a very determined person  so who knows?;Anne Hathaway;cool                  59,,,,,,,,,333
I'm a big fan of certain new acts. I love any genre of music  and I think it's really great to see that there are new artists coming through. It's kinda funny to think that I'm like the old man on campus now. But I'm really happy for groups like One Direction. I think they're really good guys.;Joe Jonas;funny                     60,,,,,,,,,333
I'm hungry for knowledge. The whole thing is to learn every day  to get brighter and brighter. That's what this world is about. You look at someone like Gandhi  and he glowed. Martin Luther King glowed. Muhammad Ali glows. I think that's from being bright all the time  and trying to be brighter.;Jay-Z;knowledge                   63,,,,,,,,,333

I don't hate humanity and I'm not interested in people who do. Although  it's funny  actually  some of my favorite writers really do. Like Martin Amis. My dirty secret.

I heard about the project over a year before we began. My American agent said  'Oh  you might want to read 'In Cold Blood' because they're talking about you for Capote  but the script's with Johnny Depp and Sean Penn at the moment.'

I've always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier  healthier life. When your health is strong  you're capable of taking risks. You'll feel more confident to ask for the promotion. You'll have more energy to be a better mom. You'll feel more deserving of love.;Jillian Michaels;health                    77,,,,,,,,,333
I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels  I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes. I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool. I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby.;Anne Hathaway;cool                     82,,,,,,,,,333
I've made movies that I thought were good. I've made movies that I thought were okay  but then I was very good. And sometimes you're in a movie and you think  I wish more people saw that - because you're good. And it just works out that the movie gets lost. But that's show business.;Christopher Walken;business                    84,,,,,,,,,333
There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion  but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the founding fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation  so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves.;Jesse Ventura;religion                    87,,,,,,,,,333
I suppose for me as an artist it wasn't always just about expressing my work I really wanted  more than anything else  to contribute in some way to the culture that I was living in. It just seemed like a challenge to move it a little bit towards the way I thought it might be interesting to go.;David Bowie;work                    92,,,,,,,,,333
I was given such a great gift. It's a miracle that never stops amazing me and reminding me to give thanks  every day. Having a wife and daughter gives me a lot more purpose.

Someday we'll learn the whole story of why George W.

Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home. I always tried to make my home like my mother's  because Mom was magnificent at stretching a buck when it came to decorating and food.

A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect  and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.

I do not believe the picture that some people paint of Scottish towns dependent on welfare. Every time I come here  I meet people who are determined to get into work.

The war on terror is the most insane and immoral war of all time. The Americans are doing what they did in Vietnam  bombing villages. But how can a civilised nation do this?

I don't think there's anything they can say about me that I haven't said about myself already.

And I believe that if we can care about whether or not our neighbor has a good job or access to affordable health care for their children  and we move to implement the policies that can improve these situations  we will unleash vast amounts of human potential and recapture the American spirit.;Tim Ryan;health                    137,,,,,,,,,333
I feel like a hostage to fortune. Not that I am complaining. I wanted to play the role. But in truth I didn't think the show would be such a success. OK  I thought it would fail.

I don't think the Palestinian people or Afghan children or some other things I'm concerned about are at the top of other people's agendas - not right now  when America is going through such a recession and people are suffering across the board financially.

One of the things I've always liked about my husband is he's very good at lots of stuff. He was an English teacher when I met him. He wrote poetry and played the guitar.

My interactions with Sorkin were agonisingly weird. He is by far the weirdest person I have ever met.

The attack on ObamaCare was that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to force a private citizen into a private contractual relationship.

I did work at a mall in college - I think retail/customer service is just one of the most hideous jobs in the world. So I always try to be extra nice when I go into a store.

I grew up in a family of strong women and I owe any capacity I have to understand women to my mother and big sister.

Barack Obama's enemies are the people who make this country work. Barack Obama's enemies are those who succeed. Those are the people whose income he wants to redistribute.

My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could.

I tried to use words that were dealing with the emotional quality that any human being could recognize in the way that they felt about their country. It's to do with the world we live in.

Being yourself is one of the hardest things because it's scary. You always wonder whether you'll be accepted for who you really are.

Bob Marley performed the 'One Love Peace' concert in Jamaica with the two different warring political sides. There's always been that in black music and culture in general.

I've met so many fans of daytime television who've watched the shows with their moms and grandmas and feel like they've known the characters their whole lives.

I tell you  it was kind of two-fold. I fortunately had a lot of support. My coach was amazing - he told me to focus on being prepared and that is what I did.

The security comes  as an actor  in knowing that you're not in control. If you try to control your career  or how people perceive you  you'll make yourself unhappy  because life doesn't work like that. So much is luck.

Of the primary emotions  fear is the one that bears most directly on survival. Children show fear. Adults try not to  maybe because it's shameful  or  in some circumstances  dangerous.

I like the idea of dating  but I'm not dating anyone exclusively  particularly right now. It's hard to be in a relationship unless you're ready to go public with it.

It's interesting now that basically a CG set is the same cost as a real set. So like if you're going to build a CG house in the suburbs  it costs you $200 000. And if you were going to build it in a computer  it'll cost you $200 000. It's the same... the relationship is exactly the same.;Zack Snyder;relationship                  135,,,,,,,,,334

We're adults. We're the ones who should teach the kids what's good to eat. I don't think the government should ever regulate what we eat at home  but we're feeding them in school with tax dollars.

One of the things I've always liked about my husband is he's very good at lots of stuff. He was an English teacher when I met him. He wrote poetry and played the guitar.

I was taught to confront things you can't avoid. Death is one of those things.

Look  at the same time that I don't want to be a celebrity  I understand that when you make movies you put yourself out in the public eye.

Sometimes  comics will make the observation that it's not jokes that are funny  it's characters that are funny. And isn't that true! That's why I always kill jokes.

In the past few years  we've been doing amazing stuff with desserts. Pastry chefs have been using herbs and spices in their desserts.

In a very weak economy  when you say 'cut government spending ' what you mean is you're laying off school teachers and you're de-funding various programs that put money into the economy.

But let me perfectly clear  because I know you'll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250 000 a year  you will not see your taxes increased a single dime.

And make sure they get a lot of love and attention you both need. That's why you have them!;Alison Sweeney;pet                    71,,,,,,,,,335
Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac  and the other was to copy Lotus' success in the spreadsheet - basically  the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years  Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost.;Steve Jobs;business                   73,,,,,,,,,335
My goal was never to just create a company. A lot of people misinterpret that  as if I don't care about revenue or profit or any of those things. But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that - building something that actually makes a really big change in the world.;Mark Zuckerberg;change                     77,,,,,,,,,335
Beside every great success are the seeds of enormous failure. In every failure  there's the opportunity seeds of great success. They're not miles apart. So if they're that close together  and if you're really working  you're always gonna have that likelihood that something's not going to work.;Peter Guber;failure                   78,,,,,,,,,335
I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels  I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes. I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool. I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby.;Anne Hathaway;design                     82,,,,,,,,,335
I challenge anybody to say that I wouldn't know how to approach foreign policy because  unlike some of the other people  I at least have a foreign policy philosophy  which is an extension of the Reagan philosophy. Peace through strength  and my philosophy is peace through strength and clarity.;Herman Cain;strength                  86,,,,,,,,,335

The thing with food is that you can give 20 people the same recipe and the same ingredients  and somebody's going to make it better than somebody else  and that's the creativity of it. It's like music. You could have a bunch of people playing the same piece  and somebody's gonna play it better.;Dweezil Zappa;food                   91,,,,,,,,,335
You all know that I have been sustained throughout my life by three saving graces - my family  my friends  and a faith in the power of resilience and hope. These graces have carried me through difficult times and they have brought more joy to the good times than I ever could have imagined.;Elizabeth Edwards;hope                    93,,,,,,,,,335
It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers ' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.;Jane Seymour;wedding                     93,,,,,,,,,335
The medical literature tells us that the most effective ways to reduce the risk of heart disease  cancer  stroke  diabetes  Alzheimer's  and many more problems are through healthy diet and exercise.

'The Panorama' is also the last place anywhere in New York where the World Trade Center still stands  whole  as it stood in the early morning of September 11. I can also see the corner where I saw the first tower fall and howled out loud. Seeing the buildings again here is uplifting  healing.;Jerry Saltz;morning                   100,,,,,,,,,335
The person who takes the oath of office in the next four months will shape not just the next four years  but the next forty years of our nation.

America needs four more years of President Barack Obama.;Rahm Emanuel;leadership                   103,,,,,,,,,335
I'm an off-road racecar driver. And I think every woman in my life has told me that's not a sensible hobby. But when I was growing  even more than I wanted to be funny  I wanted to be a racecar driver. That's all I thought about. I worked for a race team when I was 15 and I traveled with them.;Dax Shepard;funny                    130,,,,,,,,,335
I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary 'Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired ' which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case. I was involved by the film  and it was an amazing experience to see people weep at the end of it.;Harvey Weinstein;legal                    131,,,,,,,,,335
I think the success of a talk show depends on how true it is to the personality of the person hosting it. The shows I really admire  like 'Oprah' and 'Ellen ' are distinctively like their hosts  so I think my show will be successful only if we try to stay consistent to my own sense of myself.;Jane Pauley;success                   131,,,,,,,,,335
The reason that war is such a fascinating subject for writers is because it's a revealer. Put a bunch of people in an adrenaline-fuelled  life-or-death situation and their fundamental behaviours are exposed  the scrim is taken away and the motivations behind each personality come out to play.;Sloane Crosley;war                    136,,,,,,,,,335
I think there is a real misconception about Indian food being super spicy. And I know that's because when you go into an Indian restaurant  it is pretty spicy. But it doesn't have to be. In fact  my husband can't handle a lot of heat. I've had to temper my cooking so that he can eat with me.;Aarti Sequeira;food                    138,,,,,,,,,335
We are all representatives of the American people. We all do town hall meetings. We all talk to our constituents. And I've got to tell you  the American people are engaged.

My father was an inspiration to me I made a few movies with him and I loved working with him. Everything about him - his whole approach to work  as well as his love  enthusiasm and respect for it and other people in the business - was inspiring. I was very lucky to have him as a role model.;Hayley Mills;respect                    143,,,,,,,,,335
I had a really wonderful upbringing. We were a tight family. It was wonderful to grow up with so many siblings. We were all just a year or two apart  and we were always so supportive of each other. I learned everything from my older brother and sister and taught it to my younger sisters.;Joaquin Phoenix;family                     148,,,,,,,,,335
The sheep-people don't think for themselves anymore. You can say anything and it's the gospel truth and they don't have to go research it or anything  and they believe everything the news tells them. People don't go and do their own investigations if it's relationships or politics or anything.;Big Boi;politics                     149,,,,,,,,,335
Exploitation films were famous for taking an issue an exploiting it because they could move much faster than a studio could. If there was any hot topic  they would run out and make a quick movie and make a buck on it  by changing it around and using it  in some way  to give some relevance.;Robert Rodriguez;famous                  151,,,,,,,,,335
I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: 'try being rich first'. See if that doesn't cover most of it. There's not much downside to being rich  other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous  you end up with a 24-hour job.;Bill Murray;famous                    164,,,,,,,,,335
We simply can no longer afford to deny the full potential of one half of the population. The world needs to tap into the talent and wisdom of women. Whether the issue is food security  economic recovery  health  or peace and security  the participation of women is needed now more than ever.;Michelle Bachelet;food                  183,,,,,,,,,335
You pick up loads of baggage with your first record with reaction to it from fans and critics. So I went to Ireland by myself for a couple of weeks with my guitar. I read lots of poetry  I read Patti Smith's autobiography and started words and phrases and then songs started to take shape.;Ellie Goulding;poetry                     185,,,,,,,,,335
St. Louis has a lot of weird food customs that you don't see other places - and a lot of great ethnic neighborhoods. There's a German neighborhood. A great old school Italian neighborhood  with toasted ravioli  which seems to be a St. Louis tradition. And they love provolone cheese in St. Louis.;Andy Cohen;food                    187,,,,,,,,,335
I wasn't aware of my dad being an actor when I was young. I remember there was an Australian children's entertainer on television called Ralph Harris and when I'd say my father was an actor  kids would say  you know  'oh  is he Ralph Harris?' And I had to say no and then they would lose interest.;Jared Harris;dad                  189,,,,,,,,,335
There's so much with my character in 'Dredd' that I identify with. She's my favorite character I think I've ever played. She's the most dynamic and fascinating woman that I could even imagine playing  so I love her. What I love about her is that her sensitivity is her greatest strength.;Olivia Thirlby;strength                     199,,,,,,,,,335
In my books the technology that I choose to talk about has to serve the themes. What that means is that I end up having to cut out a lot of cool technology that would be really fun to describe and play with  but which would just confuse everybody. So in 'Amped ' I focus on neural implants.;Daniel H. Wilson;cool                    206,,,,,,,,,335
The trouble with anyone when they're unhappy or in a relationship they recognize is not working but don't know what to do about is that they can't see farther out than that. If the relationship is not working  if what was there isn't there anymore  you have to do something about it.;Penelope Wilton;relationship                    208,,,,,,,,,335
Violence is a problem we all want to solve. I want to make sure that kids learn to deal with anger by learning how to talk with people to solve problems. Here in the United States Senate I want to make sure we have safe schools  safe neighborhoods and good things for kids to do after school!;Patty Murray;anger                     227,,,,,,,,,335
I actually do think you're seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging. And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself. I think that's a lot of why companies are starting blogs  are just giving more insight into what's going on with them.;Mark Zuckerberg;home                     228,,,,,,,,,335
Mitt Romney has never been resigned to what someone else said was possible. He cut his own path. That's why he believes in his heart that America has a future full of opportunity and hope. And that's why when Mitt Romney looks down the road  he sees a country that's ready for a comeback.;Mitch McConnell;future                     240,,,,,,,,,335
The perennial conviction that those who work hard and play by the rules will be rewarded with a more comfortable present and a stronger future for their children faces assault from just about every direction.

After the Berlin Wall came down I visited that city and I will never forget it. The abandoned checkpoints. The sense of excitement about the future.

I want to establish a wide range and play all kinds of parts. It's that sort of acting career I really respect. I like to turn a sharp left from whatever I've done before because that keeps me awake. That's why I want to be an actor - I don't want to play endless variations on one character.;Tim Curry;respect                      310,,,,,,,,,335
Advertising ministers to the spiritual side of trade.

I think I've got my business notions and my sense for that sort of thing from my dad. My dad never had a chance to go to school. He couldn't read and write. But he was so smart.

No  I chose the name Jane Seymour because I was doing my first film  'Ode to Lovely War ' and one of the top agents in England spotted me dancing in the chorus.

Well  first of all  I think that a lot of the voters who are voting for the tea party candidates have really good impulses. That is  they believe that for years and years and years  the people with wealth and power or government power have done well and ordinary people have not. That's true.;William J.

For me  already being part of a single parent household and knowing it was just me and my mom  you'd would wake up times and hope that the next day you'd be able to be alongside your mother because she was out trying to make sure that I was taken care of.

No doubt  the White House thinks the American people know Obama's story. But since the Inauguration  we've seen only the president's present: his perfect family  his Ivy League elegance  his effortless mastery of complex issues. We never see him sweat.

You know  many people have said that I'm on the edge and I'm maverick for some of the big operations that I've done. I'm not at all. I pray I ask God to give me wisdom  'Should I do it?'  guidance in terms of how to do it  who to consult with. All those kind of things are incredibly important.;Benjamin Carson;wisdom                  8,,,,,,,,,336
Women are  in my view  natural peacemakers.

I am fussy  about my diet and straining my voice. I know  sounds a bit over the top. But I'm not as bad as I used to be.

Since September 11  security has been increased everywhere  and we have new IDs to get on to the Fox lot. I drove to the security gate  but realized I'd left my ID in my other car.

All the actors I respect  especially old-Hollywood actors  the reason I think so many of them have had long careers is that there is a sort of mystery about them. You don't know what they do on Friday nights when they go home from work. You have no clue. You have this sort of fantasy about them.;Kate Mara;respect                    24,,,,,,,,,336

The Palestinians want a state  but they have to give peace in return. What they're trying to do in the United Nations is to get a state without giving Israel peace or giving Israel peace and security. And I think that's  that's wrong. That should not succeed. That should  that should fail.;Benjamin Netanyahu;peace                   29,,,,,,,,,336

Even actresses that you really admire  like Reese Witherspoon  you think  'Another romantic comedy?' You see her in something like 'Walk the Line' and think  'God  you're so great!'

I get in trouble when I say things like  'I'm attracted to violence.' I was a pretty angry kid  and I got into military history largely as a way to vent my own anger.

When I design and wonder what the point is  I think of someone having a bad time in their life.

Music is where I have the most creative freedom  but I love producing. To me  that's kind of where all the action is. You get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film.

When I first envisioned 'Funny Games' in the mid-1990s  it was my intention to have an American audience watch the movie. It is a reaction to a certain American cinema  its violence  its naivety  the way American cinema toys with human beings.

I was going through a little bit of turbulence in my career. And so  it's funny how turbulence itself will make you hold onto something for security.

At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer  if it ever reach us  it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad.

When I left Bradford and got a phone call from Dave Parnaby asking 'did I want to come back in?'  I was delighted to accept.

During the periods in my marriage when I chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney  it caused me no end of anxiety.

I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It's embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me  it was like a second adolescence.

I'm definitely doing better. I never realized that I would get the support that I've gotten from everybody - from my fans  to people that I've idolized my whole life.

I never thought I'd be doing poetry books. I never really studied poetry.

I get along very well with the cast of '30 Rock.' I guess I bring a certain quirkiness to the show as well. I'm just thankful they keep asking me.

I'm jumping up and down and screaming.;Sherri Shepherd;thankful                    213,,,,,,,,,336
I wasn't a ballet baby. My first dance class was in an outdoor pavilion when I was three. It was called 'creative movement.' The teacher gave us chiffon scarves in beautiful colors.

The civil rights movement was based on faith. Many of us who were participants in this movement saw our involvement as an extension of our faith. We saw ourselves doing the work of the Almighty.

I was taught to confront things you can't avoid. Death is one of those things. To live in a society where you're trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy.

Parents of recovered children  and I've met hundreds  all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature's course.

Jews have a special relationship to books  and the Haggadah has been translated more widely  and reprinted more often  than any other Jewish book.

Marketing meaning that in order to get people to come you can't just go  'Hey  there's a great movie - we're not going to show you anything from it but trust us!';Paul Feig;trust                   118,,,,,,,,,337
I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary 'Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired ' which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case. I was involved by the film  and it was an amazing experience to see people weep at the end of it.;Harvey Weinstein;amazing                    131,,,,,,,,,337
The response of anybody interested in liberty is that we all have a say and the ability to have an argument is exactly what liberty is  even though it may never be resolved. In any authoritarian society the possessor of power dictates  and if you try and step outside he will come after you.;Salman Rushdie;society                    134,,,,,,,,,337
Reclaiming the word 'fat' was the most empowering step in my progress. I stopped using it for insult or degradation and instead replaced it with truth  because the truth is that I am fat  and that's ok. So now when someone calls me fat  I agree  whereas before I would get embarrassed and emotional.;Beth Ditto;truth                  150,,,,,,,,,337
I get bored. We seem to have been having a little bit more time off this winter than last winter. I'm always itching to get back in the car. It's going to get harder  so I've got to make sure that I'm doing everything I possibly can do to make sure I can start next season how I ended this season.;Dan Wheldon;car                     165,,,,,,,,,337
Working at the Food Bank with my kids is an eye-opener. The face of hunger isn't the bum on the street drinking Sterno it's the working poor. They don't look any different  they don't behave any differently  they're not really any less educated. They are incredibly less privileged  and that's it.;Mario Batali;food                   171,,,,,,,,,337

Sydney in general is eclectic. You can be on that brilliant blue ocean walk in the morning and then within 20 minutes you can be in a completely vast suburban sprawl or an Italian or Asian suburb  and it's that mix of people  it's that melting pot of people that give it its vital personality.;Baz Luhrmann;morning                    195,,,,,,,,,337
Being an actor means asking people to look at you. I guess I accept that. But it's a profession in which the job is to show another world and other people. You may access it through bits of yourself  and your imagination and experience  but actually  in the end  you're not playing yourself.;Ralph Fiennes;experience                  198,,,,,,,,,337
I think one thing that kids who grow up on farms really have going for them is they have exposure to death and birth in a totally different way. I think it takes away a little bit of the mystery and a little bit of the fear  and I do wish I had that. And I wish I was able to grow my own food.;Rachel McAdams;fear                     223,,,,,,,,,337

Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recently been dispensed by the barrel. These once unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome after-effects.

My mother is a big believer in being responsible for your own happiness. She always talked about finding joy in small moments and insisted that we stop and take in the beauty of an ordinary day.

Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do.

It's funny how I use social media because I don't use it to promote my restaurants that much. I use it for social issues and I think that's what it's for. I do a few things - I mess around with music a lot because that's a passion of mine. If something strikes me and I want to share it  I do.;Tom Colicchio;funny                     286,,,,,,,,,337
My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could. I can readily take my business personality into the home. But he forces me to be a partner rather than the boss.;Barbara Corcoran;business                      312,,,,,,,,,337
We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity. And we can help create a culture - imagine this - where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them.;Michelle Obama;health                      312,,,,,,,,,337
I couldn't be happier about being a part of 'Hunger Games' and to play Katniss. I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I don't take it lightly. I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collins' masterpiece.;Jennifer Lawrence;movies                      312,,,,,,,,,337
The fans know what's happened to me over the past couple of years. I lost my family. I pretty much got devastated financially and the fans know that I've had some hard times - and that's the nature of loyal fans.

In the early days I had a very black-and-white view of everything. I think that's kind of natural for anyone who's just embraced Islam - or any religion - as a convert. It was important for me to duck out of the fast and furious life I'd been living as a pop star. I was in a different mood.;Cat Stevens;religion                      312,,,,,,,,,337
Mind you  I've always been a very off-message type of fat broad one who gladly admits she reached the size she is now solely through lack of discipline and love of pleasure  and who rather despises people (except those with proven medical conditions) who pretend that it is generally otherwise.;Julie Burchill;medical                    8,,,,,,,,,338
Women are  in my view  natural peacemakers. As givers and nurturers of life  through their focus on human relationships and their engagement with the demanding work of raising children and protecting family life  they develop a deep sense of empathy that cuts through to underlying human realities.;Daisaku Ikeda;family                  9,,,,,,,,,338
My mother  a teacher  encouraged me to use my creativity as an actual way to make a living  and my father  a Mississippi physician  did two things.

I've definitely  you know  been with women. And I've had great relationships with them where I was definitely in love. It's just I grew to a point where deep inside I knew that I could never truly have a relationship with a woman. I don't know if they ever suspected. It was never brought up.;Lance Bass;relationship                    15,,,,,,,,,338
In the world at large  people are rewarded or punished in ways that are often utterly random. In the garden  cause and effect  labor and reward  are re-coupled.

Growing up in Nashville  especially in a music business family  means growing up with knowledge that seems like common sense until later in life when you realize people spend thousands of dollars a semester trying to learn or pretending to learn while looking for some intern job on music row.;Caitlin Rose;knowledge                    23,,,,,,,,,338
I have a great job writing for 'The Office ' but  really  all television writers do is dream of one day writing movies. I'll put it this way: At the Oscars the most famous person in the room is  like  Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I mean.;Mindy Kaling;famous                 42,,,,,,,,,338

I think of it as a good opportunity to let  in particular  school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science.

Our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed  but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us  thanks to the grace of God.

A gun can be dangerous. But a gun can protect you  you can hunt for food with it - you know  the tool itself is a tool. The intention of the party using the tool is a part of the process  right?

I developed a mechanism so that whatever mistakes I made  I would bounce straight back. Whatever was happening off the pitch  I could put it to one side and maintain my form.

I think we all suffer from guilt at some point in our lives  but for the most part I never really regret  and I try to always remain positive.

If I could be more vague I'd write more about people in my life  but I hate hurting feelings or making people feel uncomfortable. I've done that before. Unless they're sad songs.

Mom spent the time that she was supposed to be a kid actully raising children  her younger brother and younger sister. She was tough as nails and did not suffer fools at all.

Redefining marriage will have huge implications for what is taught in our schools  and for wider society.

I've always had a huge fear of dying or becoming ill. The thing I'm most afraid of  though  is being alone  which I think a lot of performers fear. It's why we seek the limelight - so we're not alone  were adored. We're loved  so people want to be around us.

I think any branding for me is band-related. It's really weird to get used to the exposure  because I am a naturally introverted person  and I'm not exactly social.

If people choose to live their life in a way that does not confront the more troubling aspects of their experience  that's fine  if it works for them.

I think there's a suspicion in the South of people putting on airs. You see it in most successful Southern politicians  but you also see it in someone like Richard Petty  who may be a multimillionaire stock car driver  but he's also beloved because he has a nice self-deprecatory way about him.;John Shelton Reed;car                   118,,,,,,,,,338
The problem for those who assert biblical authority in support of traditional definitions of marriage is that one could  with equal validity  assert that the lending of money or certain kinds of haircuts are forbidden by God  or that slavery and the subjugation of women are authorized by the Lord.;Jon Meacham;money                   119,,,,,,,,,338

One thing that worried me was how writers get categorized and so they end up having to write the same kind of book again and again. That is fine if it is what you want to do  but I would rather be locked in the trunk of my car with a weasel than write the same book every three years until I die.;Justin Cronin;car                     173,,,,,,,,,338

It used to be that you had to make female TV characters perfect so no one would be offended by your 'portrayal' of women.

And then I'd spend it on Christmas presents. I'd save up like eight pounds. It's nothing  but we did that.;Gemma Arterton;attitude                   9,,,,,,,,,339
It's true  Christmas can feel like a lot of work  particularly for mothers. But when you look back on all the Christmases in your life  you'll find you've created family traditions and lasting memories. Those memories  good and bad  are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul.;Caroline Kennedy;good                 9,,,,,,,,,339

My message  especially to young people is to have courage to think differently  courage to invent  to travel the unexplored path  courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed.

In the past  missionaries have traveled to far countries with the message of the gospel - with great hardship and often with the loss of life. In contrast  we can reach millions instantly from the comfort of our homes by merely hitting the 'send' button on our computers  or with iPads  or phones.;Ray Comfort;computers                  11,,,,,,,,,339
But you say  does it represent change? The change is that we are fighting an insurance industry that has killed health reform for generations. They're spending tens of millions of dollars right now to defeat this bill  and we're on the doorstep of winning a great victory for the American people.;David Axelrod;health                    11,,,,,,,,,339
As a young boy  I read 'Cheaper by the Dozen' and immediately became neurotic about my use of time. It taxed me severely  but only for the next 50 years. But I think it also allowed me to discipline myself to sit in the chair and be a writer  where one of the most needed qualities is patience.;Ridley Pearson;patience                   14,,,,,,,,,339
Here's a nation  one of the founding pillars was freedom of speech and freedom of expression. And yet  we have imposed upon people restrictions on what they can say  on what they can think. And the media is the largest proponent of this  crucifying people who say things really quite innocently.;Benjamin Carson;freedom                  15,,,,,,,,,339
I was a sickly baby  and after two sets of adoptive parents took me home  they returned me to the orphanage because of a serious respiratory infection.

Over the objections  where they sound like squealing pigs  over the objections of Romney and all his allies  we passed some of the toughest Wall Street regulations in history  turning Wall Street back into the allocator of capital it always has been and no longer a casino.

Your time is limited  so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

I love that for Barack  there is no such thing as 'us' and 'them' - he doesn't care whether you're a Democrat  a Republican  or none of the above... he knows that we all love our country... and he's always ready to listen to good ideas... he's always looking for the very best in everyone he meets.;Michelle Obama;best                   22,,,,,,,,,339
Given my last position  that I was the first U.S attorney post 9/11 in New Jersey  I understand acutely the pain and sorrow and upset of the family members who lost loved ones that day at the hands of radical Muslim extremists.

Every song has a composer  every book has an author  every car has a maker  every painting has a painter  and every building has a builder. So it isn't irrational to take this simple logic a little further and say that nature must have had a Maker. It would be irrational to believe that it made itself.;Ray Comfort;car                  25,,,,,,,,,339
For the blue-collar worker  the driving force behind change was factory automation using programmable machine tools.

If we all say the same thing  then I think the government has to listen. But because no one is saying it  I become singled out  even though what I'm saying is common sense.

And then I went to 'Dawson's Creek ' which is a show that was  for better or for worse  all about the language. It was a word-perfect show  which I'd never had any experience with. And it was really shocking for me. I felt really hemmed in. At the time  it wasn't my favorite working experience.;Busy Philipps;experience                 34,,,,,,,,,339
I get 0.5 seconds to react to a ball  sometimes even less than that. I can't be thinking of what XYZ has said about me. I need to surrender myself to my natural instincts.

The general consensus among historians  among the ones who can handle the fact that 'Lincoln' is  in fact  historical fiction  is that we demonstrate enormous fidelity to history and that  beyond that  we've actually contributed a line of thinking about Lincoln's presidency that's somewhat original.;Tony Kushner;history                38,,,,,,,,,339
For those who have come here illegally  they might have a transition time to allow them to set their affairs in order. And then go back home and get in line with everybody else.

From very early on in my childhood - four  five years old - I felt alien to the human race. I felt very comfortable with thinking I was from another planet  because I felt disconnected - I was very tall and skinny  and I didn't look like anybody else  I didn't even look like any member of my family.;Patti Smith;family                  41,,,,,,,,,339
Novelists are not equipped to make a movie  in my opinion. They make their own movie when they write: they're casting  they're dressing the scene  they're working out where the energy of the scene is coming from and they're also relying tremendously on the creative imagination of the reader.;John le Carre;imagination                   42,,,,,,,,,339
When money and hype recede from the art world  one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.'

I don't know if it has set in or not. Honestly  it's crazy. It's such an amazing honor. I remember thinking back to being in my room waiting for the call to see if I got the part.

A gun can be dangerous. But a gun can protect you  you can hunt for food with it - you know  the tool itself is a tool. The intention of the party using the tool is a part of the process  right?

I wish I had coined the phrase 'tyranny of choice ' but someone beat me to it. The counterintuitive truth is that have an abundance of options does not make you feel privileged and indulged too many options make you feel like all of them are wrong  and that you are wrong if you choose any of them.;Susan Orlean;truth                    49,,,,,,,,,339
I didnt work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone  because you feel differently from me.  No language can be perfect for everyone.

The thing that I've always been slightly frustrated with  was that the idea of a CD is kind of confined to a material possession that you can put on a shelf. And the idea of music  for me  is always about both the communication and the sharing of content. And so the interactive part is missing.;Yo-Yo Ma;communication                   56,,,,,,,,,339
I've never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past  but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health  because you need nutrients you only find in meats.

'WASP' is the only ethnic term that is in fact a term of class  apart from redneck  which is another word for the same group but who are in the lower social strata  so it's inexplicably tied up with social standing and culture and history in a way that the other hyphenations just are not.;Christopher Hitchens;history                   62,,,,,,,,,339
People ask 'How does doing a film compare to doing an ad?' Well  when you're doing a commercial you don't have to sell tickets. You have a captured audience. Which is actually completely rare and great it gives you a lot of freedom. When you make a film  you have to do advertisements for the film.;Mike Mills;freedom                    63,,,,,,,,,339

I think that every child grows up with the ideas that what we are given  is our society.

Sharia has become an increasingly significant force in American capitalism  thanks to the embrace by Wall Street and the U.S. government of so-called Sharia-Compliant Finance.

For the longest time I was brought up listening to only two genres of music  pop and rock.

I don't really have a style icon but I really admire the way people dress like Gaga  Rihanna and Gwen Stefani. It's good to be inspired by singers who write music and dress incredibly - rather than models and people in the fashion industry who dress immaculately anyway because it's their style.;Ellie Goulding;music                     83,,,,,,,,,339
Crucial to understanding federalism in modern day America is the concept of mobility  or 'the ability to vote with your feet.'

If I were a capitalist I would not give my employees health insurance with no deductible  which I do  including dental  and paid pregnancy leave.

I think the International Criminal Court could be a threat to American security interests  because the prosecutor of the court has enormous discretion in going after war crimes.

Well just meeting J. K. Rowling was amazing because she created all this world. And all the fans  we all get so obsessed with it and then you met the one person who made it all up.

Having a child makes you strong and gives you chutzpah. It relaxed my attitude to the job my center of focus shifted  which I think is very helpful  because even if you're not a very indulgent actor you spend a lot of time thinking about yourself.

I've got some great guy friends. They can start out as crushes. But when you realize something isn't going to happen  you make a choice whether or not the friendship is worth it. And it usually is.

Asian food is very easy to like because it hits your mouth very differently than European food does.

Comedy is so subjective. You could be in a room with 400 people laughing at a joke and you could just not think it's funny. You're just sitting there like  'Am I in the twilight zone?

I think I've got my business notions and my sense for that sort of thing from my dad. My dad never had a chance to go to school. He couldn't read and write. But he was so smart.

For some reason I can't explain  artist and musicians tend to look younger than our age. Being in music  you need this youthful sense of discovery and wonder for what you're doing and keep your imagination open. That's a youthful way of looking at life and I think that reflects in how you age.;Joshua Bell;imagination                    31,,,,,,,,,340
I took acting classes in college  and once I graduated  I decided to give acting a shot when I couldn't really think of anything else to do. It took me a couple of years to get an agent  and my first big break was The Fanelli Boys  which was a sitcom on NBC. Then I did a few television movies.;Christopher Meloni;movies                  32,,,,,,,,,340
And this President wakes up every morning  looks out across America and is proud to announce  'It could be worse.' It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? Of course not. What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better.;Mitt Romney;morning                    41,,,,,,,,,340
I think of it as a good opportunity to let  in particular  school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science. And that it's not just for a select group of people.;Ellen Ochoa;education                    42,,,,,,,,,340
I think that we're in a really amazing time  where there are really a lot of really fantastic female actresses and comedians. I imagine there's just a lot of opportunity for women to have powerful roles. Or it's just that there's more women writing TV. Women tend to maybe write strong women.;Whitney Cummings;amazing                     43,,,,,,,,,340
I did a cake for the 60th birthday of Elton John  for Britney Spears' 27th birthday and for the 'Circus' album she put out - the cake had circus themes. I prepared a cake for a surprise 82nd birthday event for the architect Frank Gehry the cake was comprised of mini-replicas of his buildings.;Ron Ben-Israel;birthday                     48,,,,,,,,,340
I started writing morning pages just to keep my hand in  you know  just because I was a writer and I didn't know what else to do but write. And then one day as I was writing  a character came sort of strolling in and I realized  Oh my God  I don't have to be just a screenwriter. I can write novels.;Julia Cameron;morning                 55,,,,,,,,,340
I remember being in Atlantic City once when I was 18 or 19  and a sea of people were screaming and pulling their hair because I was there. It was weird. Nobody deserves adulation like that. I tried to explain it to my kids once. I said  'Mommy used to be kind of cool  kind of like a Britney Spears.';Genie Francis;cool                   58,,,,,,,,,340
So when you go to a set and you just fully trust everybody  you know how hard everybody's working  you know that the people doing it are good and have such a strong vision - that's exactly my experience on 'New Girl ' and what my experience on 'Veronica Mars' was like. Everybody was just so great.;Max Greenfield;trust                   58,,,,,,,,,340
And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values  like you work hard for what you want in life. That your word is your bond that you do what you say you're going to do. That you treat people with dignity and respect  even if you don't know them and even if you don't agree with them.;Michelle Obama;respect                    60,,,,,,,,,340
I would never do a commercial for something that is embarrassing  and I think that people maybe have a different perspective on what is embarrassing or not. Some people think doing a Revlon hair commercial is really cool. To me  that's embarrassing  but World of Warcraft - not embarrassing  very cool.;Aubrey Plaza;cool                  64,,,,,,,,,340
My dad is like a cactus - introverted and tough. I'm a people person  like my mom  but I got my competitiveness from my dad.

Mild autism can give you a genius like Einstein. If you have severe autism  you could remain nonverbal. You don't want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum. But if you got rid of all the autism genetics  you wouldn't have science or art. All you would have is a bunch of social 'yak yaks.';Temple Grandin;art                    74,,,,,,,,,340
There are good people and bad people in all organizations fundamentally however  when you look at the basis of the Tea Party it has nothing to do with race. It has to do with an economic recovery. It has to do with limiting the role of our government in our lives. It has to do with free markets.;Tim Scott;government                     79,,,,,,,,,340
My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy  or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now  with age and confidence  I can say  yeah  that's true  but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.;George Saunders;age                81,,,,,,,,,340
Getting over someone is a grieving process. You mourn the loss of the relationship  and that's only expedited by 'Out of sight  out of mind.' But when you walk outside and see them on a billboard or on TV or on the cover of a magazine  it reopens the wound. It's a high-class problem  but it's real.;Hank Azaria;movingon                  82,,,,,,,,,340
Culture and tradition have to change little by little. So 'new' means a little twist  a marriage of Japanese technique with French ingredients. My technique. Indian food  Korean food I put Italian mozzarella cheese with sashimi. I don't think 'new new new.' I'm not a genius. A little twist.;Masaharu Morimoto;marriage                    84,,,,,,,,,340
I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do. I am free  no matter what rules surround me.

What's amazing is that I'm recognized all over the world through 'Red Dwarf.' British fans are exceptional  but the American fans are something else. Some of them fly 500 miles to stand in line for three hours  just to meet me  then when they do they collapse. It makes you feel like a rock star!;Craig Charles;amazing                   106,,,,,,,,,340
I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time  I have ideas for paintings all the time  and I write them all down.

It's a wonderful thing working with young actors. I know a lot of people don't like working with children. I actually adore it  because you watch their imagination open up and you watch them start to learn this job that I've been doing for so long. They come with such a lack of cynicism.;Michelle Forbes;imagination                     126,,,,,,,,,340
I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary 'Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired ' which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case.

The failure of national economic policy is costing us more than jobs it has begun to weaken that uniquely American spirit of risk-taking  large ambition  and optimism about the future.

Our platform calls for a balanced deficit reduction plan where the wealthy pay their fair share. And when your country is in a costly war  with our soldiers sacrificing abroad and our nation facing a debt crisis at home  being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfare - it's patriotism.;Cory Booker;patriotism                    137,,,,,,,,,340
We're adults. We're the ones who should teach the kids what's good to eat. I don't think the government should ever regulate what we eat at home  but we're feeding them in school with tax dollars.

I'm pretty upfront about my love and admiration for the military. One of the perks of making movies is that you get to sort of follow your own passions  and I believe quite passionately that we don't pay enough attention and respect to our veterans.

If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant.

Sid Vicious began the age of participation in which everyone could be the artist. Sid proved that you don't have to play well to be the star. You can play badly  or not even at all.

There are half a billion people that listen to music online and the vast majority are doing so illegally. But if we bring those people over to the legal side and Spotify  what is going to happen is we are going to double the music industry and that will lead to more artists creating great new music.;Daniel Ek;legal                     169,,,,,,,,,340
I think a lot of people get so obsessed with the wedding and the expense of the wedding that they miss out on what the real purpose is.

The attack on ObamaCare was that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to force a private citizen into a private contractual relationship.

I have long been one of those tedious people who rails against the coronation of 'student-athletes.' I have heard the argument that big-time athletics bring in loads of money to universities.

Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries.

I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the U.S. where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be.

Acting is fun and I refuse to get involved in the semantics and the politics of strategy and breaking out of something or doing something because you need to do something else.

I had never been to a fashion show before going to the Burberry show last month. It was an extraordinary spectacle. I was incredibly green and had no idea what an undertaking it is.

Well  first of all  I think that a lot of the voters who are voting for the tea party candidates have really good impulses.

It's true  Christmas can feel like a lot of work  particularly for mothers.

Government is force  pure and simple. There's no way to sugar-coat that.

Parents of recovered children  and I've met hundreds  all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature's course.

I believe that it is irresponsible  it is basically part of the crisis of leadership in D.C. to not look at Social Security and understand that there has got to be a solution posed.

When money and hype recede from the art world  one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.'

I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something  but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that.

It's important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact  Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent  subtle and sophisticated people  with organized societies and great art.;Henry Louis Gates;art                   125,,,,,,,,,341
I'd like to look like Madonna when I'm her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I've always wanted to be muscly  not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around  but I'm always aware if I'm getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum.;Ellie Goulding;age                    126,,,,,,,,,341
Americans different in some maybe thoughts or emphasis still have the same ideas. They want a government that lets them be free  that leaves them alone  that doesn't interrupt and interfere with every aspect of their life  that lets them go to work and keep more of what they've worked hard to have.;Mike Huckabee;alone                   127,,,,,,,,,341

Which European leader today would not relish the wonder-working powers of a Moses? Budget deficit? Unpopular cuts? How about just a little miracle  an overnight increase in gold reserves  a new oil field  or the next world-changing communications technology?

One of the big questions in the climate change debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat  it won't jump out. Instead  it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death. We humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing.;Jeff Goodell;death                    153,,,,,,,,,341
Some movies bring out the creativity in you. Every single audience member can become creative in the face of a particular movie. If you happen to like my films  it's because my films provide a bed for you on which you can find your creativity. The Hollywood movies do not provide that for you.;Abbas Kiarostami;movies                     159,,,,,,,,,341
I think what is happening is I think first of all there is confidence in the U.K. economy. We're in a German rather than a Greek position in international financial markets  which is very positive and keeps our debt service costs down  and we're also beginning to see real evidence of rebalancing.;Vince Cable;positive                    172,,,,,,,,,341
Washington's answer to a self-inflicted financial crisis reminded Americans why they so deeply distrust the political class. The 'fiscal cliff' process was secretive and sloppy  and the nation's so-called leadership lacked the political courage to address our root problems: joblessness and debt.;Ron Fournier;courage                     176,,,,,,,,,341
In my books the technology that I choose to talk about has to serve the themes. What that means is that I end up having to cut out a lot of cool technology that would be really fun to describe and play with  but which would just confuse everybody.

I cook a little bit. I make a Hungarian dish called chicken paprikash that's out of this world. I'll give a heads-up to all of your readers that it doesn't have to be between Thai and Mexican every night. Toss some Hungarian in every once in a while. You will not be sorry. Good  solid peasant food.;Adam Carolla;food                     278,,,,,,,,,341
Police departments no longer have to pay overtime or divert resources from other projects to find out where an individual goes - all they have to do is place a tracking device on someone's car or ask a cell phone company for that individual's location history and the technology does the work for them.;Ron Wyden;car                      316,,,,,,,,,341
Food during my early years was a very difficult issue for me. I grew up in an addictive family. My mother had serious problems with alcohol and prescription drugs. I was an overweight kid.

So someday in the near future hopefully rather than having a foot or a leg amputated we'll just give you an injection of the cells and restore the blood flow.

I presume that nobody will deny the positive aspects of the North American cultural world. These are well known to all.

There's something brave and touching about game girls of all ages keeping themselves smart in hard times - one thinks of those wonderful women during World War II drawing stocking seams in eyebrow pencil up the back of legs stained with gravy browning because nylons were so hard to get hold of.;Julie Burchill;women                      316,,,,,,,,,341
On banks  I make no apology for attacking spivs and gamblers who did more harm to the British economy than Bob Crow could achieve in his wildest Trotskyite fantasies  while paying themselves outrageous bonuses underwritten by the taxpayer.

Positive  healthy  loving relationships in your twenties... I don't know if anyone would disagree with it: I think they're the exception  not the norm.

By the way  movies are like sporting events in that you're as good as the movie you're in. You can sit in a room for 20 years and go do a movie and you can just kill in it and you move to the head of the line again. By the same token  you can do five movies a year and if they're dreck  it's nothing.;Albert Brooks;movies                   10,,,,,,,,,342
Your time is limited  so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important  have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.;Steve Jobs;courage                    20,,,,,,,,,342
Over the last couple of years  I've really worked toward balancing my life out more  having a little bit more time with friends  family and my boyfriend.

If you're talking to an architect  he can look at a blank piece of paper  and once the initial design is there  the formula kicks in.

I'm reading a lot of different books  but I always think I have to switch it up a little bit. It's like food - everything in moderation  same with my books  same with my reading.

We need a better way to talk about eating animals  a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits  cravings  family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation.

I had very supportive parents that made the way for me  even at a time when there were very few women - no women  really maybe two or three women - and very few  fewer than that  African-American women heading in this direction  so there were very few people to look up to.

But ours was intended to be a citizen government. It is what of  by and for the people means.

I actually think the whole concept of retirement is a bit stupid  so yes  I do want to do something else.

Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity. So it's like  just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again.

Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not  and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation.

Crucial to understanding federalism in modern day America is the concept of mobility  or 'the ability to vote with your feet.'

It gave me a lot of pleasure and pride that 90 percent of the crew for 'Monsoon Wedding ' and most of my film  are women. We get the work done  you know  much lesser play of ego...

I think opera has gained a kind of glamorous appeal. It's a live performance that aligns all of the arts  and when it is represented in the media  in film in particular  it is presented as something that is really a special event  whether it's a great date or something that's just hugely romantic.;Renee Fleming;romantic                  104,,,,,,,,,342
I just get so fed up with seeing the same things written about me. If I see the words 'ice queen' attached to me  I feel like banging my head against the wall.

The greatest way for people to experience a comedy is to go in not knowing anything about it. But because of marketing  it's impossible.

Internet marketing entrepreneurs have truly opened my eyes to just how important a quick turnaround time can be. Often times  an interview they conduct with me today is online by the next morning.

A few years ago you couldn't go from TV to film. It was like a 'no no' but I believe when you find a plan and purpose that God has for your life  there's not anything man can do to you.

Vampires are so old that they don't need to impress anyone anymore. They're comfortable in their own skin. It's this enigmatic strength that's very romantic and old-fashioned.

Christmas can have a real melancholy aspect  'cause it packages itself as this idea of perfect family cohesion and love  and you're always going to come up short when you measure your personal life against the idealized personal lives that are constantly thrust in our faces  primarily by TV commercials.;Dan Savage;family                   43,,,,,,,,,343
At an incredibly divisive point in pop history  Donna Summer managed to create an undeniable across-the-board experience of mass pleasure - after 'Bad Girls ' nobody ever tried claiming disco sucked again. It set the template for what Michael Jackson would do a few months later with 'Off The Wall.';Rob Sheffield;history                    46,,,,,,,,,343
You may be right that people say: 'You know what  we had Obama. He was inexperienced. The guy had great rhetoric  sounded good  looked good  but has turned out to be an utter disaster. I want someone where I have confidence and credibility that they're up to the job and that I can trust what they tell me.';Karl Rove;trust                  48,,,,,,,,,343
We need a better way to talk about eating animals  a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits  cravings  family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in  the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.;Jonathan Safran Foer;history                  49,,,,,,,,,343
We think that democracy can change a lot of things  but we're being fooled  because democracy is not the election. We've been taught that democracy is having elections. And it isn't. Elections are the most horrendous aspect of democracy. It's the most mundane  trivial  disappointing  dirty aspect.;Gael Garcia Bernal;change                 50,,,,,,,,,343
I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies  because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex  and all the popular kids  and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons  with tape on their glasses. I never saw 'my people' portrayed accurately.;Paul Feig;dating                  55,,,,,,,,,343

I spend plenty of time in London and it doesn't scare me  but it's a lonely place  even if you've got friends there. My job takes me all around the world  meeting lots of interesting people. But I think if I couldn't get home  if I couldn't get back to what I consider my real life I'd be frightened.;Shirley Henderson;home                  56,,,,,,,,,343
I've never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past  but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health  because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.;Joel Robuchon;positive                    58,,,,,,,,,343
The criteria for serving one's country should be competence  courage and willingness to serve. When we deny people the chance to serve because of their sexual orientation  we deprive them of their rights of citizenship  and we deprive our armed forces the service of willing and capable Americans.;Dianne Feinstein;courage                   59,,,,,,,,,343
I launched The Emeril Lagasse Foundation to provide culinary training  and developmental and educational programs to children in the cities where my restaurants operate. I think everyone has a responsibility to give back to the community if they can  and to help future generations learn new skills.;Emeril Lagasse;future                    69,,,,,,,,,343
We need to shift from an economic organizing principle for human civilization  to a humanitarian organizing principle. Making money more important than your own children is a pathological way for an individual to run their affairs  and it's a pathological way for a society to run its affairs.;Marianne Williamson;society                    77,,,,,,,,,343
The very fact that we are having a national conversation about what we should eat  that we are struggling with the question about what the best diet is  is symptomatic of how far we have strayed from the natural conditions that gave rise to our species  from the simple act of eating real  whole  fresh food.;Mark Hyman;diet                 81,,,,,,,,,343

The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history  like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past  the record of truths revealed by experience  is eminently practical  as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.;Lord Acton;future                  86,,,,,,,,,343
And I've come to the place where I believe that there's no way to solve these problems  these issues - there's nothing that we can do that will solve the problems that we have and keep the peace  unless we solve it through God  unless we solve it in being our highest self. And that's a pretty tall order.;Glenn Beck;peace                   86,,,,,,,,,343
'That's What She Said' is not Hollywood's standard picture of women: preternaturally gorgeous  wedding obsessed  boy crazy  fashion focused  sexed up 'girl' women. These are real women  comically portrayed  who are trying to wrestle with the very expectations of womanhood that Hollywood movies set up.;Carrie Preston;wedding                93,,,,,,,,,343
The dubbing of the music and effects is really incredible today. You're feeling gun shots. I mean  it's not the way people say it is  but the gunshot sounds real. And cars sound real. Among the many things in the evolution (of movies) is to make the sound in the movie incredible. That's what you feel.;Joel Silver;movies                    97,,,,,,,,,343
I've never been bashful to say that I'm not really interested in Formula One. When I lived in England  it's all I wanted to do and I thought that anything else would somehow be a compromise to my dreams. But then when I came back to the States  I realised how much I loved being back in the States.;Danica Patrick;dreams                    101,,,,,,,,,343
It's not just the kid who's spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars  it's also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car  because it's more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel  to be quite honest.;Richard Hammond;car                   122,,,,,,,,,343
'Eyes Wide Open' took shape from two real life events straight from my own past. One was the sad suicide of my young nephew  a troubled kid  who was found at the bottom of a landmark cliff in central California. The second was a chance encounter forty years ago with none other than  ahem  Charles Manson!;Andrew Gross;sad                  123,,,,,,,,,343
I'd like to look like Madonna when I'm her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I've always wanted to be muscly  not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around  but I'm always aware if I'm getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum.;Ellie Goulding;women                    126,,,,,,,,,343
Touring is tough. You're almost in a haze because you don't really know where you are half the time: You're in a hotel room one moment  and the next thing you know  you're onstage performing for 60 000 people  then you're back on an airplane. It's very hectic and I couldn't do it without my family.;Vanessa Hudgens;family                  134,,,,,,,,,343
A few years ago you couldn't go from TV to film. It was like a 'no no' but I believe when you find a plan and purpose that God has for your life  there's not anything man can do to you. Especially when your faith is not really standing in the wisdom of man  you're really standing in the wisdom of God.;Derek Luke;wisdom                    144,,,,,,,,,343
It's interesting when people make comments about celebrities' weight gain or lack of weight gain as if they're a medical professional that's treating that celebrity. Like  'This doctor does not treat Jessica Simpson  but thinks her weight is unhealthy.' If you don't treat her  then how do you know?;Busy Philipps;medical                   170,,,,,,,,,343
Part of the problem is voters know relatively little about Romney. And some of what they know about him complicates his task: Romney has a history of flip-flopping on issues  he's extraordinarily wealthy  and he can be tone-deaf about what moves voters. He just doesn't seem comfortable in his skin.;Ron Fournier;history                    173,,,,,,,,,343
I think movies do play a valuable role in turning people on to the act of reading. I think that phenomenon just creates readers. At first they're going to love 'Harry Potter ' or they may love 'The Hunger Games ' but after that  they're going to love the act of reading and wonder  'What else can I read?';Gary Ross;movies                  173,,,,,,,,,343
I turned 54 this year and I find myself feeling like I'm in a bit of a race to get down on paper the way I really feel about life - or the way it has presented to me. And because it has presented to me very beautifully  this is hard. It is technically very hard to show positive manifestations.;George Saunders;positive                     218,,,,,,,,,343
I am running for president to help create a better future. A future where everyone who wants a job can find one. Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement. An America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon.;Mitt Romney;future                      318,,,,,,,,,343
Money is not a motivating factor. Money doesn't thrill me or make me play better because there are benefits to being wealthy. I'm just happy with a ball at my feet. My motivation comes from playing the game I love. If I wasn't paid to be a professional footballer I would willingly play for nothing.;Lionel Messi;money                      318,,,,,,,,,343
But  sooner or later I'd love to do a comedy. I mean I think that  you know  people don't think that that's in my wheelhouse because I've sort of played a lot of dramatic stuff and that's certainly a side of myself that I want at some point in the right context  in the right stuff  that I find really funny.;Matthew Fox;funny                 3,,,,,,,,,344
Well  my view before was a Western view  and I certainly understand marriage equality and civil rights  equal rights for all  but having visited developing nations and some of the poorest nations in the world  I realize how deep it goes and how much work really needs to be done to create equality for all.;Jason Mraz;equality                 4,,,,,,,,,344

Theatre  when it is at its best  takes a lot of beating - the live experience and the shared collective experience of live storytelling is really special when it is good. Particularly here in New York because the audiences are amazing  very vocal and very engaged  and that makes theatre very exciting.;Dan Stevens;experience                  7,,,,,,,,,344
It's true  Christmas can feel like a lot of work  particularly for mothers. But when you look back on all the Christmases in your life  you'll find you've created family traditions and lasting memories. Those memories  good and bad  are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul.;Caroline Kennedy;christmas                 9,,,,,,,,,344
Unfortunately  the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education                     13,,,,,,,,,344
In this business  my business  I get to meet all kinds of incredible people  fascinating people  glamorous people and sexy people and highly intellectual people. And you meet them and you go 'interesting  interesting  interesting'. They're interesting  but not very many people stop you in your tracks.;Madonna Ciccone;business               16,,,,,,,,,344
Until the Eighties  Oslo was a rather boring town  but it's changed a lot  and is now much more cosmopolitan. If I go downtown  I visit the harbour to see the tall ships and the ferries  and to admire the modern architecture such as the Opera House or the new Astrup Fearnley Museum on the water's edge.;Jo Nesbo;architecture                 18,,,,,,,,,344
Government is force  pure and simple. There's no way to sugar-coat that. And because government is force  it will attract the worst elements of society - people who want to use government to avoid having to earn their living and to avoid having to persuade others to accept their ideas voluntarily.;Harry Browne;government                    19,,,,,,,,,344
I'm from a small town so  like  everyone's married with children or about to have children. So it's a little hard when you go home and people are like - and that's why people think I'm gay - because they're like 'Why aren't you married?' And I'm like  'it doesn't happen for everyone right off the bat.';Kelly Clarkson;home                   24,,,,,,,,,344
As far as the lack of hits goes  I think perhaps it's because I've played a lot of different roles and have not created a persona that the public can latch on to. I have played everything from psychopathic killers to romantic leading men  and in picking such diverse roles I have avoided typecasting.;Jeff Bridges;romantic                    31,,,,,,,,,344
If the Frieze Art Fair catches on  I imagine at least two great things happening. First  we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly  Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art                   33,,,,,,,,,344
Every animal has his or her story  his or her thoughts  daydreams  and interests. All feel joy and love  pain and fear  as we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt. All deserve that the human animal afford them the respect of being cared for with great consideration for those interests or left in peace.;Ingrid Newkirk;peace                 33,,,,,,,,,344
I wanted to be a great white hunter  a prospector for gold  or a slave trader. But then  when I was eight  my parents sent me to a boarding school in South Africa. It was the equivalent of a British public school with cold showers  beatings and rotten food. But what it also had was a library full of books.;Wilbur Smith;food                 35,,,,,,,,,344
One already feels like an anachronism  writing novels in the age of what-ever-this-is-the-age-of  but touring to promote them feels doubly anachronistic. The marketplace is showing an increasing intolerance for the time-honored practice of printing information on paper and shipping it around the country.;Lev Grossman;age                    37,,,,,,,,,344
It's fairness to say those who work hard  get up in the morning  cut their cloth - in other words 'we can only afford to have one or two children because we don't earn enough'. They pay their taxes and they want to know that the same kind of decision-making is taking place for those on benefits.;Iain Duncan Smith;morning                    40,,,,,,,,,344
More than fantasy or even science fiction  Ray Bradbury wrote horror  and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear  of anything. He wasn't afraid of looking uncool - he wasn't scared to openly love innocence  or to be optimistic  or to write sentimentally when he felt that way.;Lev Grossman;fear                 41,,,,,,,,,344
When it comes to the health of our families  Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day  another president. He didn't care whether it was the easy thing to do politically - that's not how he was raised - he cared that it was the right thing to do.;Michelle Obama;health                    43,,,,,,,,,344
It's a sad indication of where Washington has come  where policy differences almost necessarily become questions of integrity. I came to Washington in the late '70s  and people had the ability in the past to have intense policy differences but didn't feel the need to question the other person's character.;Eric Holder;sad                    50,,,,,,,,,344
I will go to the next election saying to Australians  vote for me  vote for the Liberal Party  and I will become your PM. So I'm offering myself as the alternative PM - that's one way people describe the Leader of the Opposition - but I'm not in politics for myself to realize a personal ambition.;Malcolm Turnbull;politics                   52,,,,,,,,,344
When somebody has an enormous success in this culture  people start asking two questions  which are 'What are you doing now?' and 'How are you going to beat that?' And I have to say  I love the assumption that your intention is to beat yourself constantly - that you're in battle against yourself.;Elizabeth Gilbert;success                   53,,,,,,,,,344
A supermodel needed to be able to be on 'Sports Illustrated ' to be able to walk runways  to be able to do beauty ads  to be on covers. And the girls now can no longer be on covers and be in the ads because your actresses have taken over all the jobs.

I think the part of media that romanticizes criminal behavior  things that a person will say against women  profanity  being gangster  having multiple children with multiple men and women and not wanting to is prevalent. When you look at the majority of shows on television they placate that kind of behavior.;Bill Cosby;men                  61,,,,,,,,,344
Mild autism can give you a genius like Einstein. If you have severe autism  you could remain nonverbal. You don't want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum. But if you got rid of all the autism genetics  you wouldn't have science or art. All you would have is a bunch of social 'yak yaks.';Temple Grandin;science                    74,,,,,,,,,344
Getting over someone is a grieving process. You mourn the loss of the relationship  and that's only expedited by 'Out of sight  out of mind.' But when you walk outside and see them on a billboard or on TV or on the cover of a magazine  it reopens the wound. It's a high-class problem  but it's real.;Hank Azaria;relationship                  82,,,,,,,,,344
I think people feel threatened by homosexuality. The problem isn't about gay people  the problem is about the attitude towards gay people. People think that all gays are Hannibal Lecters. But gay people are sons and daughters  politicians and doctors  American heroes and daughters of American heroes.;Hollis Stacy;attitude                   83,,,,,,,,,344
Often the magical elements in my books are standing in for elements of the real world  the small and magical-in-their-own-right sorts of things that we take for granted and no longer pay attention to  like the bonds of friendship that entwine our own lives with those of other people and places.;Charles de Lint;friendship                    85,,,,,,,,,344

Broadcasters or politicians or writers who think that they are respecting Struggle Street  the battlers  by dumbing things down into one-line sound bites are not respecting them  they are treating them with contempt.

I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing  kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong.

Mayors could never get away with the kind of nonsense that goes on in Washington. In our world  you either picked up the trash or you didn't. You either moved an abandoned car or you didn't. You either filled a pothole or you didn't. That's what we do every day. And we know how to get this stuff done.;Michael Nutter;car                     94,,,,,,,,,344
I've always been shocked and waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop that a girl would ever talk to me  let alone want to marry me. They always seem to hold the power to me  and from my mother to my wife to my daughter  every time I try to really figure them out  and think I've got them pegged  I pay for it.;Andrew Stanton;alone                 97,,,,,,,,,344
My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through  like when you're 13 and you think you're too cool for your parents. When you're embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;mom                     97,,,,,,,,,344
You never go into a marriage expecting to get divorced. You go into a marriage expecting it's going to last forever  and you have a lot of ways you dream about the future. You have all these expectations  and then you have to adjust those expectations  and it can be a very unnerving  confusing time.;Jenna Fischer;marriage                  115,,,,,,,,,344
The movie business is very difficult but the music business is just impossible. So I'll play in bands and record and play songs with other people  but for me it's a form of expression that all I need is me. I don't need cameras or agents  I can just have a piano and sing and feel totally verified.;Jeremy Renner;business                    145,,,,,,,,,344
I think Chinese leadership is trying to tell the world they have another set of logic or reasoning or values which are different from yours. Of course  I don't think they believe that. It's just an argument that's made when you can't confront the truth and facts. They really want to maintain power.;Ai Weiwei;leadership                     150,,,,,,,,,344
Washington's answer to a self-inflicted financial crisis reminded Americans why they so deeply distrust the political class.

It's about communication. It's about honesty. It's about treating people in the organization as deserving to know the facts. You don't try to give them half the story. You don't try to hide the story. You treat them as - as true equals  and you communicate and you communicate and communicate.;Lou Gerstner;communication                     235,,,,,,,,,344
When I was a child I asked my mother what homosexuality was about and she said - and this was 100 years ago in Germany and she was very open-minded - 'It's like hair color. It's nothing. Some people are blond and some people have dark hair. It's not a subject.' This was a very healthy attitude.;Karl Lagerfeld;attitude                      319,,,,,,,,,344
The only time I think about life beyond F1 is when I contemplate becoming a dad. But there's no way that's going to happen while I'm still racing. To be successful in F1 you need to be very selfish in lots of ways and you're away from home for long periods. That's not the kind of father I want to be.;Jenson Button;dad                      319,,,,,,,,,344
Just as the Security Council was largely irrelevant to the great struggle of the last half of the twentieth century - freedom against Communism - so too it is largely on the sidelines in our contemporary struggles against international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.;John Bolton;freedom                      319,,,,,,,,,344
I mean  why am I considered an 'it girl?' Because I'm in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that. Because here's the thing with 'it girl' status. It's great and amazing that anybody is saying that at all. But how long does that last?;Amanda Seyfried;hope                     6,,,,,,,,,345
You know  rock stardom... I have a hard time discussing that because I don't really accept it. It's not really that tangible. What's really bizarre is how it's used as a thing - you know  'He's the rock star of politics ' 'He's the rock star of quarterbacks' - like it's the greatest thing in the world.;Eddie Vedder;politics                   8,,,,,,,,,345
It's like  if you can't focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone  then don't go to the movies! You've got some issues  so you should probably stay home and work on those issues  and not distract everyone with lights  and sounds  oh my gosh  the tapping on the screens  it makes me crazy!;Ginnifer Goodwin;home              9,,,,,,,,,345
It's ironic  really. Guys should be excited that I got Kristen Bell. If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell  it's like  'Well  of course he did.' With me  it should be  'Oh good  a normal-looking guy got her. Maybe I'll get me a Kristen Bell.' But guys hate my guts for always dating women I have no right to be with.;Dax Shepard;dating               11,,,,,,,,,345
As an editor  I read Charlotte Rogan's amazing debut novel  'The Lifeboat ' when it was still in manuscript. I read it in one night  and I really wanted my company to publish it  but we lost it to another house. It's such a wonderful combination of beautiful writing and suspenseful storytelling.;Karen Thompson Walker;amazing                 12,,,,,,,,,345
I have a lady  she's a great lady. I love her a lot  she loves me. We're on the same page. Whenever that day happens when we're not on the same page we'll move forward with it. We're interested in having our lives be our lives right now and not a third person's vis-a-vis marriage and whatever that means.;Jon Hamm;marriage                    13,,,,,,,,,345
In South Africa  we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world  who through the use of non-violent means  such as boycotts and divestment  encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the Apartheid regime.;Desmond Tutu;freedom                  15,,,,,,,,,345
When I'm on stage  it's a little world I've created where I'm sort of the thing  so I have total control over everything that happens. When we're improvising  I'm with someone I totally trust. I know things are going to work out. I don't have those guarantees in life. There are no consequences on stage.;Colin Mochrie;trust                   17,,,,,,,,,345
In the fourth grade  my history teacher gave us a project: Why was the auto industry located in Detroit  Michigan? I didn't know I was going to be an economist  but I knew I was going to do something that was involved in answering questions like that one because I thought that was a fascinating question.;Mark Zandi;teacher                   19,,,,,,,,,345
I think it true that  you know  sometimes things start to change even before a government changes and  actually  I think you can begin to see even the Labour machine beginning to understand that it has become over-reliant on targets and processes  that local governments have been over-bossed and bullied.;David Cameron;change                 20,,,,,,,,,345
What's great about TV  and what I love about being on 'Parenthood ' is you have this family. I'm now going on four years of working with the same 100 people  and that helps you feel like your life has more roots. It's more conducive to having a family  and you're staying in town. So that part is amazing.;Dax Shepard;amazing                  21,,,,,,,,,345
It's counterintuitive  but the most divisive arrangement is when the same party controls both Congress and the presidency  a situation encountered in eight of the past 10 years. With government unified under a single party  the minority has the least possible incentive to cooperate with the majority.;John Sununu;government                   21,,,,,,,,,345
My cooking philosophy  what I try to do  is to make a cuisine where the produce and the product shines  compared to some current trends that are maybe more adding additional things  like molecular cuisine  with a lot of additives and chemicals  which are now showing that they could be bad for your health.;Joel Robuchon;health                21,,,,,,,,,345
There are more than 300 000 families in the Gulf region that lost their homes and are waiting for peace of mind. The hurricane exposed the sad reality of poverty in America. We saw  in all its horrific detail  the vulnerabilities of living in inadequate housing and the heartbreak of losing one's home.;Harry Connick  Jr.;sad                  23,,,,,,,,,345
Music was your real passion  this thing you held dear even above family. It was this relationship that never betrayed you. Once it became your job - this thing that was highly visible  this thing that became about commerce - that's when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane.;Eddie Vedder;music                    27,,,,,,,,,345
The nature of catastrophe is  after all  reasonably unvarying in the way it ruins  destroys  wounds and devastates. But if something can be learned from the event - not least something as profound as the theory of plate tectonics - then it somehow puts the ruination into a much more positive light.;Simon Winchester;positive                  28,,,,,,,,,345
I love readings and my readers  but the din of voices of the audience gives me stage fright  and the din of voices inside whisper that I am a fraud  and that the jig is up.

Because if you don't have a great workforce  a great higher education system  you're not going to have the next eBay  the next AmGen  the next  you know  Miasole  and not only California but America is going to fall behind a whole new competitive context which is obviously China  India  and other countries.;Meg Whitman;education             43,,,,,,,,,345
Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very  very good. Spending $1 000 for a ham sandwich would feel very  very bad. Spending $19 000 for a small family car would feel  well  more or less right.

I practice yoga at home to a TV show called 'Inhale ' taught by Steve Ross. I figured that if the people on the show could stretch that deep then I could too. I ended up pulling my hip flexor.

So when you do your family tree and Margaret Cho does hers  and... Wanda Sykes and John Legend... we're adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the American experience.

'Sparkle' fell into my lap. I had heard a little bit about it  that it was being redone in early 2011. I was just kind of like  'Oh  that would be really cool ' and not really thinking too much about it  and then it came through my agency. I read it  I fell in love with the script and I went in to audition.;Jordin Sparks;cool                61,,,,,,,,,345
Producing is so exciting because you can enable things to happen  whether it's like discovering a filmmaker who you're taking a chance on  protecting a battle and driving home at the end of the day just going  'I'm so glad I stayed late at work and fought hard for that.

Jim Thorpe is someone I've always loved. He was an Olympic athlete  you know  and a football player from back in the day. I'd love to play him. And then there's a guy called Iceman who was a top hit man for the mob. I would love to play him. Actually  it's sort of in the works  so I hope it goes through.;Channing Tatum;hope                  66,,,,,,,,,345
I really believe that all of us have a lot of darkness in our souls. Anger  rage  fear  sadness. I don't think that's only reserved for people who have horrible upbringings.

I appreciate the 'Surreal Life.' I had a really positive experience on that show  and with those people.

The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history  like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past  the record of truths revealed by experience  is eminently practical  as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.;Lord Acton;politics                  86,,,,,,,,,345
My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through  like when you're 13 and you think you're too cool for your parents. When you're embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;cool                     97,,,,,,,,,345
I separated from the Southern Baptists when they adopted the discriminatory attitude towards women  because I believe what Paul taught in Galatians that there is no distinction in God's eyes between men and women  slaves and masters  Jews and non-Jews - everybody is created equally in the eyes of God.;Jimmy Carter;attitude                   98,,,,,,,,,345
How rare it is that maintaining someone elses code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building  which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating.

Twenty-eight years in business and you understand the importance of problem solving and the importance of efficiency  because if you don't become efficient  you don't run a business well  and you are out of business.

The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics. People relate to each other in new ways  posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception.;Peter Singer;freedom                     119,,,,,,,,,345
I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing 'chick' music for teenage girls or something. I think  if anything  the press kind of  because of my gender and my age  tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It's part of the cultural dynamic  I guess.;Ani DiFranco;age                 124,,,,,,,,,345

You learn timing on the road. You learn structure and how to read an audience. You learn so much about the business of laughter that you can't learn on a set  because it's all on you.

One of the reasons I'm an actor is because I was no physical specimen as a child. I wasn't athletic and didn't have any prowess in that regard. Growing up in Kentucky  most little boys were trying to get into sports  and it was very competitive  so that was not to be. But I did want to do something.;Michael Shannon;sports                   166,,,,,,,,,345

You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen. It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction.

It's pretty cool that people will pay for something even though they don't have to. It's totally different now to back in the day. Now you're paying for a record because you believe in the band.

I believe there is a relationship between having an interest in the arts and the behaviour of society as a whole. Some politicians find it difficult that the arts is a weapon of happiness...

On their best days  writers all over the world are winning Pulitzers  all alone in their studios  with no one watching.;Jeffrey Eugenides;alone                  76,,,,,,,,,346
It helps immerse yourself in what you potentially want to do. Being involved  learning firsthand and observing the craft and absorbing all you can  makes it easier to define what you want. It will also ultimately make you a better Chef. Culinary school  or even a single class  is a great bet too.;Giada De Laurentiis;learning                  76,,,,,,,,,346
I basically left Texas with no money. I was making $3.50 working in some mall  so I didn't have a lot of cash. I took $1 000 and headed to California. Along the way I stopped in Vegas because I had always wanted to see Caesar's Palace. So I stopped there and won $2 500 on a slot machine! It was amazing.;Krista Allen;amazing                   77,,,,,,,,,346
The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history  like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past  the record of truths revealed by experience  is eminently practical  as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.;Lord Acton;knowledge                  86,,,,,,,,,346
The absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years  and nothing is going to be able to stop it. I see absolutely no point in pretending that it's not going to happen. I'm fully confident that copyright  for instance  will no longer exist in 10 years.;David Bowie;music                   106,,,,,,,,,346
It is jazz music that called me to be a musician and I have always sang the songs that moved me the most. Singers  like Frank Sinatra and myself  we interpret the songs that we like. Not unlike a Shakespearean actor that goes back to the greatest words ever written  we go back to the greatest songs.;Harry Connick  Jr.;music                  113,,,,,,,,,346
The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics. People relate to each other in new ways  posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception.;Peter Singer;politics                     119,,,,,,,,,346
It's not just the kid who's spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars  it's also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car  because it's more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel  to be quite honest.;Richard Hammond;sports                   122,,,,,,,,,346
I couldn't help but to think back to my classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio. They had the same talent  the same brains  the same dreams as the folks we sat with at Stanford and Harvard. I realized the difference wasn't one of intelligence or drive. The difference was opportunity.;Julian Castro;dreams                    123,,,,,,,,,346
I say let's go back to a truer use of the word 'freedom.' Let's start with President Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms: freedom of speech and expression  freedom of worship  freedom from want and freedom from fear. I would add the freedom to bargain collectively. Those freedoms are under attack today.;Richard Trumka;fear                    153,,,,,,,,,346
All of us in society are supposed to believe that cruelty to animals is wrong and that it is a good thing to prevent needless suffering. So if that is true  how can meat be acceptable under any but the most extraordinary circumstances  such as perhaps roasting the bird who died flying into a window?;Ingrid Newkirk;society                    155,,,,,,,,,346
If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant. Personal liberty is the purpose of government  to protect liberty - not to run your personal life  not to run the economy  and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live.;Ron Paul;government                   157,,,,,,,,,346
You learn timing on the road. You learn structure and how to read an audience. You learn so much about the business of laughter that you can't learn on a set  because it's all on you. Sometimes you bomb  and you know not to tell that joke again... You just hope people find the humor in the awkwardness.;Marlon Wayans;humor                    157,,,,,,,,,346
I'm moving on. I should have made that clear when I made the announcement. I guess I wasn't clear. If people think you're leaving a show after all these years  you might be retiring. So I understand where they're coming from  but I should have impressed the fact that I hope I'm just moving on right now.;Regis Philbin;hope                    158,,,,,,,,,346
I'm happy that I feel a little less out of place in filmmaking than I once was - but it's almost impossible for a playwright in the U.S. to make a living. You can have a play  like I did with 'Angels ' and it still generates income for me  but it's not enough for me to live on and have health insurance.;Tony Kushner;health                   174,,,,,,,,,346
I know children regress after vaccination because it happened to my own son. Why aren't there any tests out there on the safety of how vaccines are administered in the real world  six at a time? Why have only two of the 36 shots our kids receive been looked at for their relationship to autism?;Jenny McCarthy;relationship                     178,,,,,,,,,346
Think about all the great leaders. Think about Obama. Think about Clinton. Think about Nelson Mandela. Think about all the people that we know who are very successful in business  in politics and religion. What are they? They tell purposeful stories. They move people to action by aiming at the heart.;Peter Guber;religion                     178,,,,,,,,,346
There's the famous thing that the A&ampR man from the record company is supposed to do: He's supposed to come into the studio and listen to the songs you've been recording and then say  'Guys  I don't hear any singles.' And then everybody falls into a terrible depression because you have to write one.;Jarvis Cocker;famous                    184,,,,,,,,,346
Between France and Senegal there's a history. There's a language that we both speak. There's a culture that we share and to which both of our peoples have contributed. But beyond our history  beyond our language  beyond the links that have united us for so long  what unites us today is the future.;Francois Hollande;history                   190,,,,,,,,,346
The universities have got a job here as well in making sure that people actually understand that we're open for university students coming into the U.K. There's a job here not just for the government  I think there's a job for the universities as well to make sure that people know that we are open.;Theresa May;government                     199,,,,,,,,,346
There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it  I think  how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?;Michael Kors;design                    218,,,,,,,,,346
I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I'm more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world. When all this is over  what are you left with? When I retire  I hope I am remembered for being a decent guy.;Lionel Messi;hope                    218,,,,,,,,,346
There is a group of individuals who are radical jihadists. We need to call them by name. They believe it is OK to kill people in the name of their religion. It is not all of Islam. It is not all Muslims. But there is a subgroup who believe it is OK. In fact  it is their plan and design to kill people.;Tim Pawlenty;design                     257,,,,,,,,,346
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.

I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art                      321,,,,,,,,,346
You'd like more people to recognise what you do is special. But I take the attitude that the best thing I can do for my sport is to be the best at it. The best way people will come to recognise that track and field is a great sport is to see athletes excelling at it. Which is what I intend to do.;Maurice Greene;attitude                      321,,,,,,,,,346
I am running for president to help create a better future. A future where everyone who wants a job can find one. Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement.

For 13 to be unlucky would require there to be some kind of cosmic intelligence that counts things that humans count and that also makes certain things happen on certain dates or in certain places according to whether the number 13 'is involved' or not (whatever 'is involved' might mean).;Douglas Hofstadter;intelligence                      321,,,,,,,,,346
Yeah  well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track  just crush it. So if you like fast cars  you'll love this car. And then oh  by the way  it happens to be electric and it's twice the efficiency of a Prius.;Elon Musk;car                 4,,,,,,,,,347
I mean  why am I considered an 'it girl?' Because I'm in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that. Because here's the thing with 'it girl' status. It's great and amazing that anybody is saying that at all. But how long does that last?;Amanda Seyfried;movies                     6,,,,,,,,,347
You know  there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care. We are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly don't need one. We got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it.;Eric Cantor;health                     8,,,,,,,,,347
Of course  there is no question that Libya - and the world - will be better off with Gaddafi out of power. I  along with many other world leaders  have embraced that goal  and will actively pursue it through non-military means. But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.;Barack Obama;change                  9,,,,,,,,,347
It's like  if you can't focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone  then don't go to the movies! You've got some issues  so you should probably stay home and work on those issues  and not distract everyone with lights  and sounds  oh my gosh  the tapping on the screens  it makes me crazy!;Ginnifer Goodwin;movies              9,,,,,,,,,347
As human beings  we are vulnerable to confusing the unprecedented with the improbable. In our everyday experience  if something has never happened before  we are generally safe in assuming it is not going to happen in the future  but the exceptions can kill you and climate change is one of those exceptions.;Al Gore;experience                  15,,,,,,,,,347
The more anxious  isolated and time-deprived we are  the more likely we are to turn to paid personal services. To finance these extra services  we work longer hours. This leaves less time to spend with family  friends and neighbors we become less likely to call on them for help  and they on us.;Arlie Russell Hochschild;finance                 16,,,,,,,,,347
There are more than 300 000 families in the Gulf region that lost their homes and are waiting for peace of mind. The hurricane exposed the sad reality of poverty in America. We saw  in all its horrific detail  the vulnerabilities of living in inadequate housing and the heartbreak of losing one's home.;Harry Connick  Jr.;peace                  23,,,,,,,,,347
According to the Jain view  soul is that element which knows  thinks and feels. It is in fact the divine element in the living being.

Every time I've done comedy in  like  traditional comedy clubs  there's always these comedians that do really well with audiences but that the other comedians hate because they're just  you know  doing kind of cheap stuff like dancing around or doing  like  very kind of base sex humor a lot  and stuff like that.;Aziz Ansari;humor              30,,,,,,,,,347
Don't ever know who you may meet  or just because a person may not be dressed up all fancy  don't mean they're not an important person. You just don't ever know who you're gonna meet in life.

If the Frieze Art Fair catches on  I imagine at least two great things happening. First  we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly  Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;change                   33,,,,,,,,,347
I've thought for the last decade or so  the only actual place raw truth was seeping through in newspapers was on the Comics Pages.

Everyone has that friend who's every day  like  'I hate my nose  I hate my nose  I hate my nose.'

More than fantasy or even science fiction  Ray Bradbury wrote horror  and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear  of anything. He wasn't afraid of looking uncool - he wasn't scared to openly love innocence  or to be optimistic  or to write sentimentally when he felt that way.;Lev Grossman;science                 41,,,,,,,,,347
I think there have always been funny women  from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman  they innately know she's worked twice as hard to get there  she's had to prove that she can be the leader  first  and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she's in control.;Wendy Liebman;funny                 42,,,,,,,,,347
I want to work with kids and help develop them  show them the right way  the right morals and attitude into how to become a better footballer.

I think it's brought the world a lot closer together  and will continue to do that. There are downsides to everything there are unintended consequences to everything.

There's a sense of aliveness that comes from connection  shared experience. And you see it in every place. You see it when ball players jump up and down  gather at home plate  hugging  and it's not just because they're winning  it's that shared moment  that feeling of - we enter the world alone  we leave alone.;Peter Guber;alone               55,,,,,,,,,347
There are so many things to talk about between black people  Hispanic people  white people  gay people  men  women  it's all based on fear.

Most songs have meager beginnings. You wake up in the morning  you throw on your suspenders  and you subvocalize and just think. They seem to form like calcium. I can't think of a story right off the bat that was that interesting. I write things on the back of my hand  usually  and sing into a tape recorder.;Tom Waits;morning                  61,,,,,,,,,347
I know there are lots of positives in the evolution of technology  but I also think it will be responsible for the end of a unique character  of a specific kind of geographical culture.

Storytelling in general is a communal act. Throughout human history  people would gather around  whether by the fire or at a tavern  and tell stories. One person would chime in  then another  maybe someone would repeat a story they heard already but with a different spin. It's a collective process.;Joseph Gordon-Levitt;history                 67,,,,,,,,,347
If you know that life is basically going to be horrendously difficult  at best  and all but unlivable at worst  or possibly even unlivable  do you go on? And the choice to go on is the only thing that I think can be called hope. Because if hope isn't forced to encounter the worst possibility  then it's a lie.;Tony Kushner;hope                 69,,,,,,,,,347
There was a time in L.A. when I drove to 7-Eleven to go grocery shopping  and I locked my keys in my car  which wasn't insured. My wallet was in there  and I couldn't call AAA  because I only had $7 in my bank account. It was one of those moments where I was like  'O.K.

My political science degree is always on the back-burner. I took my LSAT  so even if I want to take the LSAT again  I know what I'm getting into. I'll keep it on the back-burner.

I really believe that all of us have a lot of darkness in our souls. Anger  rage  fear  sadness. I don't think that's only reserved for people who have horrible upbringings.

When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria  you've got to be prepared  as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan  to become the government  and I'm not sure any country  either the United States or I don't hear of anyone else  who's willing to take on that responsibility.;Colin Powell;government                77,,,,,,,,,347

I am an optimist about the UK. We have been involved in trade with our European partners  which we will always be doing whatever this relationship is. We are a member of the EU.

There's no artist in this world that doesn't enjoy the dream that if they have bad reviews now  the story of Keats can redeem them  in their fantasy or imagination  in the future.

Besides the healthcare bill being unconstitutional and a great expansion of federal government  I think if it does not respect people's individual religious views and makes groups or individuals do things that are contrary to their deeply held beliefs  there is going to be a visceral negative reaction.;Bob McDonnell;respect                    94,,,,,,,,,347
If there's any object in human experience that's a precedent for what a computer should be like  it's a musical instrument: a device where you can explore a huge range of possibilities through an interface that connects your mind and your body  allowing you to be emotionally authentic and expressive.;Jaron Lanier;experience                    95,,,,,,,,,347
What I like about sceptics is that in good science you need critics that make you think: 'Crumbs  have I made a mistake here?' If you don't have that continuously  you really are up the creek. The good sceptics have done a good service  but some of the mad ones I think have not done anyone any favours.;James Lovelock;science                   96,,,,,,,,,347
Conservatism is not about leaving people behind. Conservatism is about empowering people to catch up  to give them the tools at their disposable that make it possible for them to access all the hope  all the promise  all the opportunity that America offers.

You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  no matter how old they are or how much money they have.

Flipping the dial through available radio stations there will blare out to any listener an array of broadcasts  24/7  propagating Religious Right politics  along with what they deem to be 'old-time gospel preaching.'

What's important at the grocery store is just as important in engines or medical systems. If the customer isn't satisfied  if the stuff is getting stale  if the shelf isn't right  or if the offerings aren't right  it's the same thing. You manage it like a small organization. You don't get hung up on zeros.;Jack Welch;medical                  121,,,,,,,,,347
I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing 'chick' music for teenage girls or something. I think  if anything  the press kind of  because of my gender and my age  tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It's part of the cultural dynamic  I guess.;Ani DiFranco;music                 124,,,,,,,,,347
One of the principal goals in my life has been to avoid embarrassing my children by doing the job I do.

I must say  my three are most agreeable children  who do nothing but delight me.;Hugh Laurie;hope               134,,,,,,,,,347
Find your self-respect now. Don't dumb yourselves down. Think of yourself as capable and worthy of finding a guy who is going to respect you  too.

Nobody has ever denied that when it comes to his trade - gigolo - John Forbes Kerry is one of the all-time greats. He's in the Gigolo Hall of Fame.

I've worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and you're in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room. You're taken care of and the food is amazing  the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work.;Dominic Monaghan;food                     162,,,,,,,,,347
Vision gets the dreams started. Dreaming employs your God-given imagination to reinforce the vision.

You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen. It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction.

There is not necessarily a good reason why a regulator should have to be involved in product design and marketing for rich and sophisticated investors.

What drew me to politics in the first place was the fact that I wanted to have a place to take a stand and use my voice to express what I believed in. But I've no longer got any political aspirations.

One thing I have frankly decided is that when it comes to political reform we have two conservative parties in British politics. Both the Labour and Conservative parties have constantly and repeatedly failed to honour promises they have made about reforming  cleaning  modernising our clapped-out system.;Nick Clegg;politics                    257,,,,,,,,,347
More people have more access to more readers for less money than ever before in history. It means a lot of dross but it means a lot of very talented people can find and nurture a readership in ways that were not possible twenty years ago. From a creative perspective  that is all that writing is about.;John Hodgman;history                     266,,,,,,,,,347
There is only one home to the life of a river-mussel there is only one home to the life of a tortoise there is only one shell to the soul of man: there is only one world to the spirit of our race. If that world leaves its course and smashes on boulders of the great void  whose world will give us shelter?;Wole Soyinka;home                     270,,,,,,,,,347
Football is my profession now. I'm getting married in August... It's a new experience for me as someone just getting out of college. I still have the same attitude about football I always had. I play hard. I enjoy practice. I'd rather be throwing in passing drills than sitting around and watching TV.;Doug Flutie;attitude                      322,,,,,,,,,347
Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable. The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack.;Lewis Thomas;medical                      322,,,,,,,,,347
President Obama has outsourced a major portion of the U.S. space program to the Russians. That's national policy. Taxpayer money. So let's stop playing games with this outsourcing distortion and talk about the fact that when we need is a president that knows how to manage big enterprise and create jobs.;John Sununu;money                      322,,,,,,,,,347
Look  I'm very much in favor of tax cuts  but not with borrowed money. And the problem that we've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money  tax cuts with borrowed money  and at the end of the day that proves disastrous. And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here.;Alan Greenspan;money                  4,,,,,,,,,348
I mean  why am I considered an 'it girl?' Because I'm in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that. Because here's the thing with 'it girl' status. It's great and amazing that anybody is saying that at all. But how long does that last?;Amanda Seyfried;amazing                     6,,,,,,,,,348
Ultimately  if you can say that I'm a bad owner and we're winning championships  I can live with that. But if we're not making the playoffs and we're spending and losing money  then I have to look in the mirror and say maybe I'm not taking the necessary steps to doing what it takes to run an organization.;Michael Jordan;money                   10,,,,,,,,,348
Maybe that first  gigantic deficit the Reaganites piled up was an accident  just a combination of deluded 'supply side' tax cuts and a huge bag of good stuff for the Pentagon. But pretty quickly conservatives discovered that deficits  when done correctly  did something really cool: deficits defunded the Left.;Thomas Frank;cool                  16,,,,,,,,,348
I didn't see it then  but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again  less sure about everything.

9/11 was a deliberate  carefully planned evil act of the long-waged war on the West by Koran-inspired soldiers of Allah around the world. They hated us before George W. Bush was in office. They hated us before Israel existed. And the avengers of the religion of perpetual outrage will keep hating us.;Michelle Malkin;religion                     21,,,,,,,,,348
You look at the steamboat  the railroad  the car  the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world  but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture  the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.;Walter Russell Mead;car                 25,,,,,,,,,348
The truth of the matter is  beauty is a specific thing  rare and fleeting. Some of us have it in our teens  20s and 30s and then lose it most of us have it not at all. And that's perfectly okay.

While it's really hard to do  at the same time  I'm escaping my body  which I really want to do. I'm living someone else's life. I get very intensely into the story  into the interviews and the research. I'm experiencing things along with my subjects.

I would love to continue in music  with writing... but I am not the kind of person who will hang around if I start to become irrelevant. If that happens  I will bow down gracefully  raise my kids  and have a garden. And I am going to let my hair go gray when I am older. I don't need to be blonde when I'm 60!;Taylor Swift;music                  33,,,,,,,,,348
When a person tests positive for HIV  it is not a test for the virus itself but for antibodies to the virus  and the test is not able to distinguish between HIV antibodies and a multitude of other antibodies. Many conditions can lead to a false positive result  including flu shots  hepatitis  and pregnancy.;Nate Mendel;positive                 36,,,,,,,,,348
When I started out as a music journalist  at the end of the 1980s  it was generally assumed that we were living through the lamest music era the world would ever see. But those were also the years when hip-hop exploded  beatbox disco soared  indie rock took off  and new wave invented a language of teen angst.;Rob Sheffield;teen                 40,,,,,,,,,348
There's no regret. You can't regret. I mean  I've felt regret but I've also refused to allow regret to sow a seed and live in me because I don't believe it. You feel it  it's like guilt  it's like jealousy  it's like all those horrible things. You've just got to snip them and get them out  because they're no good.;Jude Law;good                 43,,,,,,,,,348
Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very  very good. Spending $1 000 for a ham sandwich would feel very  very bad. Spending $19 000 for a small family car would feel  well  more or less right.

I deeply believe that if the Australian Labor Party  a party of which I have been a proud member for more than 30 years  is to have the best future for our nation  then it must change fundamentally its culture and to end the power of faceless men. Australia must be governed by the people  not by the factions.;Kevin Rudd;future                  51,,,,,,,,,348
I hope people don't compare 2D and 3D because 3D's new  it's unfair to compare to 2D which is really sophisticated  even when we're jaded about it. 3D just began  give it a chance  let the equipment and projection system catch up and be better  let the price go down  let more filmmakers get a hold of it more easily.;Ang Lee;hope                54,,,,,,,,,348
When I was a child I used to read books by Gerald Durrell  who founded Jersey Zoo. He had a job collecting animals for zoos and for a long time that is what I wanted to do. Later when I was a teenager I had a fantastic English teacher called Mrs. Stafford. Her enthusiasm made me decide to be a writer.;Melvin Burgess;teacher                     57,,,,,,,,,348
Women oftentimes are the ones making those economic decisions  sitting around the kitchen table and trying to figure out how to pay for rising gas prices or food prices or the health insurance costs.

When I was six years old my friend was auditioning for 'Annie ' and I decided I wanted to audition with her. My mom was worried I would fall flat on my face because I'd never opened my mouth to sing  so she sent me to vocal lessons.

If the states and territories do not sign up to fundamental reform  then my message is equally simple: we will take this reform plan to the people at the next election - along with a referendum by or at that same election to give the Australian Government all the power it needs to reform the health system.;Kevin Rudd;health                     66,,,,,,,,,348
Everything's changed. The technology is the big thing changing now  the way movies like 'Alice' or 'Avatar' are made. And technology on the other side  the audience side.

You always give credit where credit is due - to high school coaches  college coaches - but my dad  the foundation that he built with me  is where all of this came from.

The first responsibility of the Muslim is as teacher. That is his job  to teach. His first school  his first classroom is within the household. His first student is himself.

Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not  and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity  it is the power to that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared.;J. K.

I have long said there are three distinct groups under the GOP's tent: theological warriors  who want to impose their social views on the rest of society Tea Party zealots  who say with a straight face that they want the government to get out of their Medicare and remnants of the pro-business moderates.;Eliot Spitzer;society                    91,,,,,,,,,348
My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through  like when you're 13 and you think you're too cool for your parents. When you're embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;amazing                     97,,,,,,,,,348
There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries  too. Wright lived into his 90s  and one of his most famous buildings  the Guggenheim Museum in New York  was completed just before his death.

You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  no matter how old they are or how much money they have.

What I remember most about junior homecoming was my date getting sick afterwards. That kinda sucked. Then  senior year  someone got gum in her hair when we were dancing. She had to get one of the chaperones to take her to the office and cut up her hair. I felt really bad for her  but it worked out fine.;James Lafferty;dating                   105,,,,,,,,,348
My fans mean everything to me - especially the sisters! When you're on 'The View' or you're doing movies and stuff  you're a little bit insulated. It means so much to me when a woman comes up to me and says  'Sherri  you said what I feel.' That just means so much to me to know that I have that support.;Sherri Shepherd;movies                   114,,,,,,,,,348
I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome  but in not trying. It is liberating. Most people attach failure to something not working out or how people perceive you. This way  it is about answering to yourself.;Sara Blakely;failure                    137,,,,,,,,,348
I went through a phase when I was 13 where I would only fall in love with people over the age of 19 or 20. I never had a real relationship with any of these people  but it was definitely the guy I wanted to hang out with and wanted to go on trips with. I would be like  'But  Daddy  he's a musician!'.;Olivia Wilde;relationship                  163,,,,,,,,,348
Successful prime-time television of any genre produces some kind of emotional reaction in the viewers. There are a lot of different emotions to tap into.

I've criticized President Bush for his failure to use his veto pen. There's plenty of blame to go around. The question is how to solve problems. It's not bailouts. What made America great?

I know in my own marriage I stayed in it to provide my son with what I thought was a stable background and to give him what I thought was the family life a child should have with two parents. But that isn't always the best way  and it took me taking my son to therapy after the divorce to really see it.;Regina King;marriage                     226,,,,,,,,,348
I like Mitt Romney as a person. I think he's a dignified person. But I have no common ground on economics. He doesn't worry about the Federal Reserve. He doesn't worry about foreign policy.

It is clear I was never the Pretty Girl. I had my two front teeth knocked out when I was 10 and didn't fix them until I was 19. I have a crooked smile and a nose that looks like it's been broken 12 times but never has been. My nose was always red  so people called me Rudolph.

Olympia was a town crawling with music. I was new to the whole punk scene. The culture shock continued Olympia had bagels! We didn't have bagels in Arkansas.

I believe there is a relationship between having an interest in the arts and the behaviour of society as a whole. Some politicians find it difficult that the arts is a weapon of happiness...

I think it true that  you know  sometimes things start to change even before a government changes and  actually  I think you can begin to see even the Labour machine beginning to understand that it has become over-reliant on targets and processes  that local governments have been over-bossed and bullied.;David Cameron;government                 20,,,,,,,,,349
In these dangerous times  where it seems the world is ripping apart at the seams  we can all learn how to survive from those who stare death squarely in the face every day  and we should reach out to each other and bond as a community  rather than hide from the terrors of life at the end of the millennium.;Jonathan Larson;death                  24,,,,,,,,,349

I think romance is a tool  comedy is a tool and drama is a tool. I really just want to tell stories that challenge the viewer  move people  make you laugh  perhaps push an idea about being open-minded but never settle on a genre or an opinion. I hate genre.

When I started this project  I was a young architect. I was very apprehensive about any changes to the design.

In response to our fast-food culture  a 'slow food' movement appeared. Out of hurried parenthood  a move toward slow parenting could be growing.

In order to lead a country or a company  you've got to get everybody on the same page and you've got to be able to have a vision of where you're going.

Clinton is a big personality who has led a big life  and for some of the media conventional wisdom to boil it down to a view that 'all people are really interested in' are a few moments of madness in the Oval Office gets him  the importance of the presidency  and the significance of his life  all wrong.;Alastair Campbell;wisdom                  51,,,,,,,,,349

Instead  I think of more like  'I'll probably be with this person for the next six weeks. Then I'll re-evaluate.';Michael Ian Black;marriage                  92,,,,,,,,,349
There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries  too. Wright lived into his 90s  and one of his most famous buildings  the Guggenheim Museum in New York  was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;famous                  98,,,,,,,,,349
To have the opportunity to lead the Solicitor General's office is the honor of a lifetime. As you know  this is an office with a long and rich tradition  not only of extraordinary legal skill but also of extraordinary professionalism and integrity. That is due  in large measure  to the people who have led it.;Elena Kagan;legal                  102,,,,,,,,,349
I have reviewed literally hundreds of dotcoms in my drive to bring Boomer Esiason Foundation onto the Internet  and have selected ClickThings as a partner because of the advanced technology it offers small business  and its understanding of the entrepreneurial spirit of the small business community.;Boomer Esiason;technology                    110,,,,,,,,,349
I think everyone who makes movies should be forced to do television. Because you have to finish. You have to get it done  and there are a lot of decisions made just for the sake of making decisions. You do something because it's efficient and because it gets the story told and it connects to the audience.;Joss Whedon;movies                     120,,,,,,,,,349
My father was brought up in an orphanage in the Catskills. He was a factory worker. And because his family wasn't there for him  family was everything. We could disagree inside the house  but outside the house it was us against the world. So when I became a drag actor  he looked sideways but said okay.;Harvey Fierstein;family                   127,,,,,,,,,349
I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome  but in not trying. It is liberating. Most people attach failure to something not working out or how people perceive you. This way  it is about answering to yourself.;Sara Blakely;attitude                    137,,,,,,,,,349
God's plan for enlarging His kingdom is so simple - one person telling another about the Savior. Yet we're busy and full of excuses. Just remember  someone's eternal destiny is at stake. The joy you'll have when you meet that person in heaven will far exceed any discomfort you felt in sharing the gospel.;Charles Stanley;god                     146,,,,,,,,,349
Technologists provide tools that can improve people's lives. But I want to be clear that I don't think technology by itself improves people's lives  since often I'm criticized for being too pro-technology. Unless there's commensurate ethical and moral improvements to go along with it  it's for naught.;Jaron Lanier;technology                    147,,,,,,,,,349
I say let's go back to a truer use of the word 'freedom.' Let's start with President Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms: freedom of speech and expression  freedom of worship  freedom from want and freedom from fear. I would add the freedom to bargain collectively. Those freedoms are under attack today.;Richard Trumka;freedom                    153,,,,,,,,,349
Like all young reporters - brilliant or hopelessly incompetent - I dreamed of the glamorous life of the foreign correspondent: prowling Vienna in a Burberry trench coat  speaking a dozen languages to dangerous women  narrowly escaping Sardinian bandits - the usual stuff that newspaper dreams are made of.;Russell Baker;dreams                    168,,,,,,,,,349
I'm well past the age where I'm acceptable. You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines  you're not going to get played on radio and you're not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth.;David Bowie;age                     182,,,,,,,,,349
There is a Western world. There is America. There is Great Britain and Germany and France and Russia and China and other nations.

Republicans rarely criticize Obama for lack of empathy - in part because liberals have traditionally been seen as standing up for the weak and the vulnerable. Conservatives can be just as empathetic. But they believe that  in most cases  it's not government's role to be the primary dispenser of empathy.;Gary Bauer;government                    221,,,,,,,,,349
I love what the Valley does. I love company building. I love startups. I love technology companies. I love new technology. I love this process of invention. Being able to participate in that as a founder and a product creator  or as an investor or a board member  I just find that hugely satisfying.;Marc Andreessen;technology                    225,,,,,,,,,349
Olympia was a town crawling with music. I was new to the whole punk scene. The culture shock continued Olympia had bagels! We didn't have bagels in Arkansas. You could order vegetarian food all over town!

My father always taught by telling stories about his experiences. His lessons were about morality and art and what insects and birds and human beings had in common. He told me what it meant to be a man and to be a Black man. He taught me about love and responsibility  about beauty  and how to make gumbo.;Walter Mosley;beauty                    267,,,,,,,,,349
The great thing about celebrity culture is that they can't seem to stop themselves from displaying their ridiculous behaviour. I feel it's my job as a serious investigative journalist to witness all kinds of behaviour and then report back to the audience through the prism of my own anger and bitterness.;Kathy Griffin;anger                      324,,,,,,,,,349
I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.;Taylor Lautner;hope                      324,,,,,,,,,349
Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable. The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack.;Lewis Thomas;knowledge                      324,,,,,,,,,349
I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;movies                      324,,,,,,,,,349
Thankfully  due to the United Kingdom and the commitment of the Westminster government we are able to ensure that money brought in  whether it be from the City of London or from North Sea oil  can be pooled and directed to wherever it is needed most. That is what being in the United Kingdom is all about.;Iain Duncan Smith;money                   10,,,,,,,,,350
Unfortunately  corruption is widespread in government agencies and public enterprises. Our political system promotes nepotism and wasting money.

You show up in Paris  and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you're like  'This is so cool! I want to see something! I want to go to the Eiffel Tower!' And then you leave the next morning.

Movies don't look hard  but figuring it out  getting the shape of it  getting everybody's character right and having it be funny  make sense and be romantic  it's creating a puzzle. Yes  having been a writer for so long  I have an awareness of when things are going awry  but it doesn't mean I know how to fix them.;Nancy Meyers;funny              22,,,,,,,,,350
For the last five years  we have been presented with the idea that Barack Obama is superhuman. Barack Obama is unlike any of us or anyone else. And he isn't. In fact  he's much less achieved and much less accomplished than most who have gotten half as far as he has  and I think maybe what we saw was the best.;Rush Limbaugh;best                   23,,,,,,,,,350
I know there are people  if I go into a market or a city for the first time  there are people that are there that just want to see the famous person  or the guy from 'Dumb and Dumber' or whatever movie they liked.

It's kind of interesting  because hacking is a skill that could be used for criminal purposes or legitimate purposes  and so even though in the past I was hacking for the curiosity  and the thrill  to get a bite of the forbidden fruit of knowledge  I'm now working in the security field as a public speaker.;Kevin Mitnick;knowledge                 24,,,,,,,,,350
I'm in awe of the universe  but I don't necessarily believe there's an intelligence or agent behind it. I do have a passion for the visual in religious rituals  though  even though they may be completely empty and bereft of substance.

When I started this project  I was a young architect. I was very apprehensive about any changes to the design. Whether I wanted to or not  I learned that you can accept some changes to its form without compromising its intent.

When we'd suggested doing it  the Theatre Royal management had said  'Nobody wants to see Waiting for Godot.'

It was amazing.;Ian Mckellen;amazing                  28,,,,,,,,,350
My father is a real idealist  and he's all about learning. If I asked for a pair of Nikes growing up  it was just a resounding 'No.' But if I asked for a saxophone  one would appear and next day and I'd be signed up for lessons. So anything to do with education or learning  my father would spare no expense.;Hugh Jackman;learning                  28,,,,,,,,,350
I was a bartender for a long time  so I know how to make drinks  but I'm more likely to offer them than to have them. I think this is one of the reasons why I get to live longer than my great-grandmother did  and why I get to produce more writing than she did  and why my marriage isn't in dire straits.;Elizabeth Gilbert;marriage                  33,,,,,,,,,350
What I've discovered is that in art  as in music  there's a lot of truth-and then there's a lie. The artist is essentially creating his work to make this lie a truth  but he slides it in amongst all the others. The tiny little lie is the moment I live for  my moment. It's the moment that the audience falls in love.;Lady Gaga;art                  35,,,,,,,,,350
In response to our fast-food culture  a 'slow food' movement appeared. Out of hurried parenthood  a move toward slow parenting could be growing. With vital government supports for state-of-the-art public child care and paid parental leave  maybe we would be ready to try slow love and marriage.;Arlie Russell Hochschild;parenting                   36,,,,,,,,,350
We are biological creatures. We are born  we live  we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

I understand why creative people like dark  but American audiences don't like dark. They like story. They do not respond to nervous breakdowns and unhappy episodes that lead nowhere.

But I think it's more that when you're young  you're invincible  you're immortal - or at least you think you are. The possibilities are limitless  you're inventing the future.

Housing Works is the coolest thrift store in the world  because not only are they the best thrift store - they're not the most thrifty thrift store - but they have amazing stuff and all of their proceeds go directly to kids  mostly homeless kids  living with AIDS and HIV in New York  in the metropolitan area.;Ezra Miller;amazing                  54,,,,,,,,,350

There are two types of courage involved with what I did. When it comes to picking up a rifle  millions of people are capable of doing that  as we see in Iraq or Vietnam.

While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices  an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It's not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves.

Most of us in the baby-boom generation were raised by full-time mothers. Even as recently as 14 years ago  6 out of 10 mothers with babies were staying at home. Today that is totally reversed.

Feature-length film comedy is harder to pull off than the episodic sitcom - it doesn't have the same factory machinery up and running  teams of writers putting familiar characters through permutations - but that doesn't explain the widening quality gap that makes movie humor look like a genetic defective.;James Wolcott;humor                     133,,,,,,,,,350
It's not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish.

There are many countries where you can only believe more or you can believe less.

The only protection as a historian is to institute a process of research and writing that minimizes the possibility of error.

The fact that we're going through a crisis is an opportunity for Europe to be more coordinated and more integrated.

We believe that what we possess we don't ultimately own. God is merely entrusting it to us. And one of the conditions of that trust is that we share what we have with those who have less.

One reason outfielders don't have stronger arms might be they don't practice as much as we did. Most teams today don't take outfield practice.

We need to get back to reasoning and thinking things through. The future generation is being brought up in greed and without a true understanding of civics.

But  at the end of the day  we need to represent the taxpayers who have made enormous sacrifices. Many have lost their jobs.

They have seen their health care benefits be shredded.;John Kasich;health                    3,,,,,,,,,351
Yom Kippur  the Day of Atonement  is the holy of holies of Jewish time. It is that rarest of phenomena  a Jewish festival without food.

All my life  Americans have been accustomed to thinking of theirs as 'the richest  freest' country in the world.

I grew up in Chicago  so I've always been a Bears fan. Dad used to take me to Bears games and Cubs games.

I remember those guys out there as monsters - they were the biggest things I've ever seen!;Kyle Chandler;dad                     20,,,,,,,,,351
When you think about it  we actors are kind of prostitutes. We get paid to feign attraction and love. Other people are paying to watch us kissing someone  touching someone  doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone who's not their partner. It's really kind of gross.;Megan Fox;relationship                   23,,,,,,,,,351
In his first year in office  President Obama pulled us back from the brink of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression and worked to lay a new foundation for economic growth. The president identified three key strategies to build that lasting prosperity: innovation  investment  and education.;Tom Vilsack;education                   27,,,,,,,,,351
My father is a real idealist  and he's all about learning. If I asked for a pair of Nikes growing up  it was just a resounding 'No.' But if I asked for a saxophone  one would appear and next day and I'd be signed up for lessons. So anything to do with education or learning  my father would spare no expense.;Hugh Jackman;education                  28,,,,,,,,,351
You have the right to kill me  but you don't have the right to judge me. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody  so just shut your traps and put down your McDonalds  your vaccines  your Us Weekly  your TMZ and the rest of it.;Charlie Sheen;life                 29,,,,,,,,,351
When museums are built these days  architects  directors  and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties  eat dinner  wine-and-dine donors. Sure  these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art                33,,,,,,,,,351
What I've discovered is that in art  as in music  there's a lot of truth-and then there's a lie. The artist is essentially creating his work to make this lie a truth  but he slides it in amongst all the others. The tiny little lie is the moment I live for  my moment. It's the moment that the audience falls in love.;Lady Gaga;work                  35,,,,,,,,,351
I envy people with dreams and passions  but I don't think that way. I still don't have a 'bliss' to follow. For people like me - I suspect that's most people - holding out for a 'dream' or a 'passion' is paralyzing. I just like having work I enjoy that feels meaningful. That's hard enough... but it's enough.;Jane Pauley;dreams                     38,,,,,,,,,351
I've been on so many movies. Generally  I haven't gotten to be on the ground level. As of two years ago  in 'Dear John ' I got to really be on the ground floor. I wasn't a producer. I felt like I put the work in  and I did have a lot of sway on what got fixed  reshoots  so on and so forth. It felt really good.;Channing Tatum;movies                38,,,,,,,,,351
When women earn the money for the family  everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income  everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health  education  to food security  to the children  to the family  or to the community  so when women have an income  everybody wins.;Michelle Bachelet;food             40,,,,,,,,,351
I have this desire to just while away weeks  months and years. It took me two years to make this record but that was with me trying to condense my process and not disappear down the rabbit hole with all the cool things I've collected. I could take 10 years and not explore everything I want to with these instruments.;Gotye;cool                     43,,,,,,,,,351
But I think it's more that when you're young  you're invincible  you're immortal - or at least you think you are. The possibilities are limitless  you're inventing the future. Then you get older and suddenly you have a history. It's fixed. You can't change anything. I find that a bit disturbing  to be honest.;Damien Hirst;history                  44,,,,,,,,,351
If you're out there stressing on your pro day  then you're not going to perform well  so I plan on having a little fun. Play a little music while we're out there throwing the football  have everybody tapping their toes and bobbing their head and just go out there and make the most of the experience.;Robert Griffin III;experience                   45,,,,,,,,,351
I had to weave and play around with a honey bear  you know  and I could wrestle with him a little bit  but there's no way you can even wrestle a honey bear  let alone a grizzly bear that's standing ten feet to eleven feet tall! Can you imagine? But it was fascinating to work that close to that kind of animal.;Leslie Nielsen;alone                  48,,,,,,,,,351
The Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again  Lord. They've taken your Bible away from the schools. They've forbidden little children to pray. They've taken the knowledge of God as best they can  and organizations have come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of America.;Pat Robertson;best                    54,,,,,,,,,351
I know that many of you do wear such a cross of Christ  not in any ostentatious way  not in a way that might harm you at your work or recreation  but a simple indication that you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world  that you are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.;Keith O'Brien;work                  54,,,,,,,,,351
I went to drama school for four years at Carnegie Mellon  conservatory training before television comedy. I was doing Shakespeare and Chekov plays. It's about delivering on the promise of a $100 000 education and taking the shackles off and trying the hand at my craft. I'm thrilled with what I've seen so far.;Josh Gad;education                    56,,,,,,,,,351
Here's the thing: the unit of reverence in Europe is the family  which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in Sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in America. Here we revere the couple  there they revere the family.;Elizabeth Gilbert;family                    63,,,,,,,,,351
Hopefully with each thing that you do you're learning something  you're growing  and you're pushing yourself a little harder in some way or another. So I think you'd be in real trouble if each new thing that you create didn't feel like 'Oh  wow. I feel like I'm doing something a little different this time.';Rian Johnson;learning                   63,,,,,,,,,351
Personal identity seems like it's just such an American archetype  from Holly Golightly re-inventing herself in 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' to Jay Gatsby in 'The Great Gatsby.' It seems like the sort of archetypal American issue. If you're given the freedom to be anything  or be anyone  what do you do with it?;Chuck Palahniuk;great                   65,,,,,,,,,351
The technology is really where all of the changes have taken place  but the fundamentals of a good story being the basis of every good picture  and really the only basis still remains the rule  more so today  I think  because we've unfortunately weaned an audience from birth to kind of mindless movies.;Richard D.

The first responsibility of the Muslim is as teacher. That is his job  to teach. His first school  his first classroom is within the household. His first student is himself. He masters himself and then he begins to convey the knowledge that he has acquired to the family. The people who are closest to him.;H. Rap Brown;knowledge                    69,,,,,,,,,351
A Nicklaus Design golf course is done by the guys in my company that I work with  that have been trained in my vision  and they do what they think I might do. They might come in the office and ask me questions and I'd certainly answer their questions  but I'm not involved in the site visits or anything else.;Jack Nicklaus;design                   80,,,,,,,,,351
The most common objection that I hear to walking as exercise is that it's too easy  that only sweaty  strenuous activity offers real benefits. But there is abundant evidence that regular  brisk walking is associated with better health  including lower blood pressure  better moods and improved cholesterol ratios.;Andrew Weil;health                 82,,,,,,,,,351
There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected  to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented  and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.;Mark Zuckerberg;society                    82,,,,,,,,,351
There's a continuity between what I care about in any form: I care about it in my music  in article-writing  in how I dress  in how I live  in my relationships  in how I navigate paparazzi  how I decorate my home. There's such a continuity between everything that I don't really care what form it shows up in.;Alanis Morissette;music                87,,,,,,,,,351
With 'Believe' bringing really big success for me outside of the U.K. for the first time  it meant I have been touring around the world and that led to a gap from the studio. I really feel like the gap has done me the world of good. Throughout that time I was able to collect songs that I really loved.;Katherine Jenkins;success                     88,,,,,,,,,351
I have long said there are three distinct groups under the GOP's tent: theological warriors  who want to impose their social views on the rest of society Tea Party zealots  who say with a straight face that they want the government to get out of their Medicare and remnants of the pro-business moderates.;Eliot Spitzer;government                    91,,,,,,,,,351
Spare a thought for the poor introverts among us. In a world of party animals and glad-handers  they're the ones who stand by the punch bowl. In a world of mixers and pub crawls  they prefer to stay home with a book. Everywhere around them  cell phones ring and e-mails chime and they just want a little quiet.;Jeffrey Kluger;home                   94,,,,,,,,,351
I believe economic growth should translate into the happiness and progress of all. Along with it  there should be development of art and culture  literature and education  science and technology. We have to see how to harness the many resources of India for achieving common good and for inclusive growth.;Pratibha Patil;happiness                   96,,,,,,,,,351
You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. And now more than ever  it is the gateway to a middle-class life.;Barack Obama;education                    100,,,,,,,,,351
We assume that we've come so far as compassionate citizens of the world if we do choose to read the news  yet the attitude towards life can be one where we put blinders on and forget that there are civil wars going on. It's easy to forget that there are so many people starving to death every single day.;Anne Hathaway;attitude                     104,,,,,,,,,351
It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films  loved her. It was amazing working with someone who was American as well  because obviously it's going to be a different energy straightaway. We got on really well she's so professional and hardworking.;Kaya Scodelario;cool                    104,,,,,,,,,351
I see the Beijing National Stadium as an architectural project. I accepted Herzog and De Meuron's invitation to collaborate on the design  and our proposal won the competition. From beginning to end  I stayed with the project. I am committed to fostering relationships between a city and its architecture.;Ai Weiwei;architecture                    137,,,,,,,,,351
It's not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers  and I grew up in a very funny  conversational house and didn't have television. This small family farm was a bubble world that didn't have much to do with reality.;Elizabeth Gilbert;family                    138,,,,,,,,,351
Making movies is not rocket science. It's about relationships and communication and strangers coming together to see if they can get along harmoniously  productively  and creatively. That's a challenge. When it works  it's fantastic and will lift you up. When it doesn't work  it's almost just as fascinating.;Julia Roberts;movies                  151,,,,,,,,,351
I'm fascinated by the journey that an intelligent and an ambitious woman makes in the professional world in contrast to the journey that a man of similar ambition  of similar intelligence makes. What sort of concessions does a woman have to make? Does she have to work 20 percent harder than a man?;Charles Cumming;intelligence                     162,,,,,,,,,351
The fabric of North Carolina and what makes our state so special is our families and our common desire for a brighter future for our children.

I'm well past the age where I'm acceptable. You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines  you're not going to get played on radio and you're not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth.;David Bowie;music                     182,,,,,,,,,351
I am fascinated by all the new technology that creates places for us to meet in what is called cyberspace. I understand what it must have meant for the rebellions in the 19th century  especially in 1830 and 1848  when the mass circulated newspaper became so important for the spreading of information.;Henning Mankell;technology                    182,,,,,,,,,351
Those who remember Washington's cold war culture in the 1980s will recall the shocked reactions to Reagan's intervention. People interested in foreign policy were astonished when in 1985 he met alone at Geneva - alone  not a single strategic thinker at his elbow! - with the Soviet Communist master Gorbachev.;Russell Baker;war                     217,,,,,,,,,351
I had someone call me this morning telling me they had somebody who would only work a certain number of hours a week because if they worked too many hours a week then they couldn't get their government assistance. And that person has multiple cell phones  and gets them new every month with new minutes.;Timothy Griffin;morning                     254,,,,,,,,,351
I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.;Taylor Lautner;movies                      326,,,,,,,,,351
At home in L.A.  Sunday is lazy. It's the wife and me lying in bed with coffee  watching 'The Soup' or something funny on TiVo. The kid will occasionally join us. Eventually  breakfast is at a place down the street called Paty's. And we always have some kind of great dinner - my wife makes a great roast beef.;Eric McCormack;funny                   15,,,,,,,,,352
When I was a kid  I wanted to be serious  like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor  do they? Now I realise how stupid that is - and it's because comic acting isn't taken seriously enough. It's a discipline. You know instantly - either you're funny and getting the laughs  or you're not.;Chris O'Dowd;dreams                  16,,,,,,,,,352
From time to time  I'll look back through the personal journals I've scribbled in throughout my life  the keepers of my raw thoughts and emotions. The words poured forth after my dad died  when I went through a divorce  and after I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There are so many what-ifs scribbled on those pages.;Hoda Kotb;dad                  17,,,,,,,,,352
I told the President  I told Rahm Emanuel and others in the administration that I thought the policy they took to try to bring about negotiations is counter-productive  because when you give the Palestinians hope that the United States will do its negotiating for them  they are not going to sit down and talk.;Charles Schumer;hope                   20,,,,,,,,,352
Like all soul singers  I grew up singing in church but sometimes I would leave early and sit in the car listening to gospel band  The Blind Boys of Alabama. Hearing their lead singer Clarence made me connect the idea of church and show business and see how I could make a career singing music that stirred the soul.;Daryl Hall;car                    21,,,,,,,,,352
In giving us children  God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else's sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child's interests first. Yet  according to His perfect design  it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.;Charles Stanley;god                   21,,,,,,,,,352
Music was your real passion  this thing you held dear even above family. It was this relationship that never betrayed you. Once it became your job - this thing that was highly visible  this thing that became about commerce - that's when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane.;Eddie Vedder;relationship                    27,,,,,,,,,352
The prospects for a coherent  hilarious and consistent American comedy seem to lessen every year  as the poor waterlogged  gassy corpse called 'Evan Almighty' proved when it floated ashore recently.

There's no regret. You can't regret. I mean  I've felt regret but I've also refused to allow regret to sow a seed and live in me because I don't believe it. You feel it  it's like guilt  it's like jealousy  it's like all those horrible things.

In almost every profession - whether it's law or journalism  finance or medicine or academia or running a small business - people rely on confidential communications to do their jobs.

The Internet is the hope of an integrated world without frontiers  a common world without controlling owners  a world of opportunities and equality.

There's been times when I've had heartbreaking moments and I'm like  'I can't believe you said that ' or 'I can't believe you did that'.

Government is taking 40 percent of the GDP. And that's at the state  local and federal level. President Obama has taken government spending at the federal level from 20 percent to 25 percent.

My parents are both very funny but they're also relatively soft-spoken  normal human beings while I'm just a lunatic. I don't know where this loud  ballsy  hammy ridiculousness came from.

My mom thought I might be good for voiceover. She thought I had a cute voice  so maybe I could do a cartoon or something.

And it kind of just snowballed from there.;Atticus Shaffer;mom                  76,,,,,,,,,352

The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology  but it will date it. By definition. Eventually  it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out.

My goal when I started out was to get to the point where I could tour a lot and make a living  which means getting paid enough to hire my own band  travel and end up with a bit of money  but I'm still nowhere near that point.

There's no artist in this world that doesn't enjoy the dream that if they have bad reviews now  the story of Keats can redeem them  in their fantasy or imagination  in the future.

We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war  a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.

One of the most gratifying things I get as an artist is when people watch me do these different demonstrations  and they in some way feel empowered by what I'm doing so they can confront their own fears. Maybe it's the fear of getting in an elevator maybe it's the fear of going on a plane and seeing the world.;Criss Angel;fear                     110,,,,,,,,,352
I would expect illegal alien parents to take care of their children. If it means the kids go back home with them  that's what happens. If it means there are legal relatives in the United States that can take care of them  that can happen to. But I believe it's the parents responsibility to take care of the kids.;Mo Brooks;legal                    112,,,,,,,,,352
I've always been part of comedy. One of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other  particularly my two brothers and myself  when my father was upset with something you'd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh.

I couldn't help but to think back to my classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio. They had the same talent  the same brains  the same dreams as the folks we sat with at Stanford and Harvard. I realized the difference wasn't one of intelligence or drive.

Faith is the substance of hope - of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.

In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can't even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot  we said it means Hanson Is Murder.

In a relationship when things are really great you don't need to say anything and just enjoy the other person. Sometimes with a couple  it gets dark and you don't know what to say and that silence can last all day.

I've worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and you're in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room. You're taken care of and the food is amazing  the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work.;Dominic Monaghan;happiness                     162,,,,,,,,,352
It's far too much to say that effective hoping is the only - or even the biggest - part of what it takes to succeed. If 14% of business productivity can be attributed to hope  that means 86% is dependent on raw talent  fickle business cycles  the quality of the product you're selling  and often pure  dumb luck.;Jeffrey Kluger;hope                 174,,,,,,,,,352
More brands are waking up to their social responsibility and doing good work through cause marketing campaigns. Yet too many still go about it the wrong way. I mean 'wrong' in two senses. Firstly  they are marketing ineffectively  and secondly  as a consequence their positive social impact is not maximized.;Simon Mainwaring;work                   195,,,,,,,,,352
I don't like staying in hotels. I like to be in my own bed. San Diego as a city is really awesome. The only hard part of it for me is that I'm away from my family and my house. But as far as shooting down there  we get amazing locations  and the crew is really  really stellar down there. They are really fun.;Kristen Bell;amazing                   210,,,,,,,,,352
The debt-ceiling vote isn't about what will be done in the future it is about the integrity of America's commitment to support the bonds we issue. Elected officials have an obligation to maintain that integrity  regardless of whether they voted for the programs that required the borrowing in the first place.;John Sununu;future                     210,,,,,,,,,352
I will check the internet for at least an hour every morning scanning worldwide news to do with child abuse. So if you're constantly putting yourself in an environment where you're checking up on social economics or homelessness problems  if you keep yourself aware of it  you don't really have a day off.;Samantha Morton;morning                    237,,,,,,,,,352
My siblings and I were friends with the boys who would become our stepbrothers - we grew up on the same street. I feel very special to have these amazing people in my life and if we hadn't all moved into this big house together I think I would have missed out on that  because we would have drifted apart.;Florence Welch;amazing                     267,,,,,,,,,352
When I first started acting I was about nine years old. I had never been to audition in my life and my agent sent me out. It was just a commercial for 'Harry Potter.' That was the first thing I ever went out for and I got the 'Harry Potter' commercial which was really cool  but I didn't play Harry Potter.;Alexander Ludwig;cool                     273,,,,,,,,,352
When I look back over my life it's almost as if there was a plan laid out for me - from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to Africa and whose family couldn't afford to put her through college. Everyone laughed at my dreams. I was supposed to be a secretary in Bournemouth.;Jane Goodall;dreams                      327,,,,,,,,,352

The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren't putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.;Jeff Bezos;home                      327,,,,,,,,,352
Ascetics and fakirs come to mitigate human suffering to heal us and lead us on the path. They put up with criticism they go through many worldly trials. Some of them have even become martyrs for our sake. But they have done all this with a smile and with gratitude to God. Hence sacrifice is a great virtue.;Sadhu Vaswani;smile                      327,,,,,,,,,352
Listen  I think movies serve many different purposes  from those movies that are frivolous and just an entertainment  to movies that just go to exploring the complexities of the human soul. Everything is valid if it's done with honesty and dignity  and I actually do both of those types of movies in my career.;Antonio Banderas;movies                  6,,,,,,,,,353
You show up in Paris  and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you're like  'This is so cool! I want to see something! I want to go to the Eiffel Tower!' And then you leave the next morning.

Credit or debit cards  for starters  are nothing short of shoppers' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money  we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic.;Jeffrey Kluger;age                   21,,,,,,,,,353
My parents were really  really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12  I did this show on Broadway called 'High Society ' so we moved to New York for the run of that.;Anna Kendrick;age                   22,,,,,,,,,353
During the 80s and 90s  we all became consumed with ourselves. In the 21st century  we've come back to simpler times. People are struggling economically and this has forced them to scale back the material aspects of their lives and realise the beauty of finding the simple joy in being with the people we love.;Julia Roberts;beauty                    22,,,,,,,,,353
Movies don't look hard  but figuring it out  getting the shape of it  getting everybody's character right and having it be funny  make sense and be romantic  it's creating a puzzle. Yes  having been a writer for so long  I have an awareness of when things are going awry  but it doesn't mean I know how to fix them.;Nancy Meyers;romantic              22,,,,,,,,,353
Over the past few years  the road to confrontation has shown its consequences: loss of innocent lives  destruction and fear. Most costly  however  was the loss of hope.

When I'm home on a break  I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours  I start getting into this total meditation. It's a feeling few people experience  and that's usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can't force myself. I don't sit down and say I've got to practice.;Eddie Van Halen;home                   24,,,,,,,,,353

When museums are built these days  architects  directors  and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties  eat dinner  wine-and-dine donors. Sure  these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;money                33,,,,,,,,,353
Stabilizing the euro is one thing  healing the culture that surrounds it is another. A world in which material values are everything and spiritual values nothing is neither a stable state nor a good society.

Tennis is all about mental toughness  and you have to keep your head in the game. I make time to relax away from competition pressures  travel and intense training schedules to make sure I'm looking after myself.

Clearly this is a tough economic time  and a lot of families are hurting. So when we talk to parents  we talk about small changes for kids and things that don't cost extra money. Like adding water and eliminating sugary drinks and sodas. That's going to save money right there. Or adding a few more vegetables.;Michelle Obama;money                    37,,,,,,,,,353
We are biological creatures. We are born  we live  we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence. At best we are creatures of reason  and by using reason we can cure ourselves of emotional excess. Purged of both hope and fear  we find courage in the face of helplessness  insignificance and uncertainty.;Jonathan Sacks;courage                 40,,,,,,,,,353
When women earn the money for the family  everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income  everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health  education  to food security  to the children  to the family  or to the community  so when women have an income  everybody wins.;Michelle Bachelet;health             40,,,,,,,,,353
Choreography is amazing. I'm still a dancer  yet I transitioned into choreography then as a Creative Director. All of these creative elements are brought out of being a dancer. Directing is something that comes out of understanding movement and choreography. Directing movement is directing a dance piece.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing                     43,,,,,,,,,353
Although in skating you compete with other people  anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better  learn more  learn faster  is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life.;Vera Wang;success                  49,,,,,,,,,353
In the richest country in the history of the world  this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4 0  but health insurance premiums are higher  food prices are higher  utility bills are higher  and gasoline prices have doubled.

I know that many of you do wear such a cross of Christ  not in any ostentatious way  not in a way that might harm you at your work or recreation  but a simple indication that you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world  that you are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.;Keith O'Brien;easter                  54,,,,,,,,,353
The American people I talk to don't spend every moment thinking  'How can I tax my neighbor more than they're being taxed?' They say  'How can I get a good job? How can my kids get good jobs?

Personal identity seems like it's just such an American archetype  from Holly Golightly re-inventing herself in 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' to Jay Gatsby in 'The Great Gatsby.'

My goal is to make Italian food clean and accessible and beautiful and tasty  with simple ingredients that people can find at a local grocery store  because people don't want to go to a gourmet shop in search of items that will sit in their pantry for years after they use just a teaspoon or pinch of them.;Giada De Laurentiis;food                    76,,,,,,,,,353
We live in a world where sports have the potential to bridge the gap between racism  sexism and discrimination. The 2012 Olympic Games was a great start but hopefully what these games taught us is that if women are given an opportunity on an equal playing field the possibilities for women are endless.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;sports                     83,,,,,,,,,353
I honestly believe you can never tell if a relationship is going to last. In my own marriage  which is going on 14 years  I don't think of it as 'I'm going to be with this person forever.' Instead  I think of more like  'I'll probably be with this person for the next six weeks. Then I'll re-evaluate.';Michael Ian Black;relationship                  92,,,,,,,,,353
While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices  an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It's not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It's a change of mood or expectation  a desire for art to be more than showy effects  big numbers  and gamesmanship.;Jerry Saltz;change                  96,,,,,,,,,353
My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through  like when you're 13 and you think you're too cool for your parents. When you're embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;relationship                     97,,,,,,,,,353
I maintain my inner beauty by trying to lead a balanced life in general. I try to eat healthy foods  but... that doesn't mean I won't treat myself now and then!

We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war  a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.

America traditionally represents the greatest possibility of someone's going from nothing to something. Why? In theory  if not practice  the government stays out of the way and lets individuals take risks and reap rewards or accept the consequences of failure. We call this capitalism - or  at least  we used to.;Larry Elder;failure                  118,,,,,,,,,353
I've always been part of comedy. One of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other  particularly my two brothers and myself  when my father was upset with something you'd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh.

It's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money. I can tell you  though: If they don't really want to build a company  they won't luck into it. That's because it's so hard that if you don't have a passion  you'll give up.;Steve Jobs;money                   156,,,,,,,,,353
Making movies is a very different experience in a lot of ways. It's difficult when you're used to owning the copyright and having a landlord's possessory rights - I rent my plays to the companies that do them and  if I'm upset  I can pull the play. But the only two directors I've worked with are pretty great.;Tony Kushner;movies                    212,,,,,,,,,353
Those who remember Washington's cold war culture in the 1980s will recall the shocked reactions to Reagan's intervention. People interested in foreign policy were astonished when in 1985 he met alone at Geneva - alone  not a single strategic thinker at his elbow! - with the Soviet Communist master Gorbachev.;Russell Baker;alone                     217,,,,,,,,,353
I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. English people are always known to be well mannered and cold but we are not cold - we don't interfere in your situation.

I do not deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence.

The sad thing is that I feel so boring because 'Twilight' is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it's someone I'm meeting for the first time or someone I just haven't seen in a while.

You've got to honor your relationship with your audience - that they sit down because they want to be entertained. And that doesn't mean you can't provoke them and antagonize them and challenge them in the course of the entertainment as long as you keep the entertainment part of the equation alive.;David E.

I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts.

Yeah  it's odd when you look back at your own work. Some filmmakers don't look back at their work at all. I look at my work a lot  actually.

You see  Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment.

It's sad when you can't make everyone happy  though. It's impossible but  at the same time  you still hope. You think  'Maybe I can do it ' but you know you can't.

There's a lot of gimmick infringement out there  but that's cool. It's a compliment. But it all started right when I first came into the Garden.

People were being so mean as a result of my ability - a gift  really. So I think that's what makes me fight harder to provide an option to aspiring kids or artists.

They said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics  to take on public-sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy.

There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected  to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented  and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.;Mark Zuckerberg;technology                    82,,,,,,,,,354
A pet store is a celebration of dogs' existence and an explosion of options. About cats  a pet store seems to say  'Here  we couldn't think of anything else.' Cats are the Hanukkah of the animal world in this way. They are feted quietly and happily by a minority  but there's only so much hoopla applicable to them.;Sloane Crosley;pet                  87,,,,,,,,,354
Our pets rely on us entirely for their nutrition. So if you're making your own judgments  that could lead to a mistake. At the same time  we have more control over our pet's diet than we do with our children or with ourselves  so your vet can tell you what is appropriate for your dog and you can assign them that.;Alison Sweeney;pet                   88,,,,,,,,,354
Urban America has been redlined. Government has not offered tax incentives for investment  as it has in a dozen foreign markets. Banks have redlined it. Industries have moved out  they've redlined it. Clearly  to break up the redlining process  there must be incentives to green-line with hedges against risk.;Jesse Jackson;government                  89,,,,,,,,,354
Why doesn't Apple stop for a year and make medical devices? When people talk about technology  that's where I start to get a little hot under the collar because I know that it's the key to solving some of the world's biggest problems. Having a faster  thinner telephone is not one of the world's biggest problems.;Luke Perry;medical                    93,,,,,,,,,354
Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air  or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead  we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.;Fred Upton;science                    98,,,,,,,,,354
It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films  loved her. It was amazing working with someone who was American as well  because obviously it's going to be a different energy straightaway. We got on really well she's so professional and hardworking.;Kaya Scodelario;amazing                    104,,,,,,,,,354
It is critical to develop a biofuel industry powered by feedstocks produced in every corner of the country  in addition to the Midwest.

It is always a disappointment to turn from forthright consideration of some subject - whether from the Left or the Right  a poet or a plumber - to the Beltway version  in which the only aspects of the issue that matter are the effects it will have on the fortunes of the two parties and the various men in power.;Thomas Frank;power                    120,,,,,,,,,354
I've exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years. For the most part  these communications took place before my marriage  though some have sadly took place after. To be clear  I have never met any of these women or had physical relationships at any time.;Anthony Weiner;marriage                   122,,,,,,,,,354
Faith is the substance of hope - of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. So if you can hope for it and imagine it  and keep imagining and hoping and seeing yourself driving a new car  or seeing yourself getting that job  or seeing yourself excel  seeing yourself help that person - that is faith.;Duane Chapman;faith                  130,,,,,,,,,354
In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can't even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot  we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn't have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.;Ville Valo;history                     132,,,,,,,,,354
I was for civil unions and believed strongly that the flow of benefits and protections that would be provided in a civil union for same-sex couples  the decisions that have to be made  when health hardships are faced  when economic hardships are faced  I wanted all of those protections.

I think I was lucky to come of age in a place and time - the American South in the 1960s and '70s - when the machine hadn't completely taken over life. The natural world was still the world  and machines - TV  telephone  cars - were still more or less ancillary  and computers were unheard of in everyday life.;Ben Fountain;computers                  189,,,,,,,,,354

I've led a school whose faculty and students examine and discuss and debate every aspect of our law and legal system. And what I've learned most is that no one has a monopoly on truth or wisdom.

There is much that public policy can do to support American entrepreneurs. Health insurance reform will make it easier for entrepreneurs to take a chance on a new business without putting their family's health at risk. Tort reform will make it easier to take prudent risks on new products in a number of sectors.;Eric Ries;health                      329,,,,,,,,,354
The thing that I think is the most important is taking moments to express your appreciation to your partner. A thank you or a quick kiss can go a long way toward affirming your relationship and commitment to each other.

Thankfully  due to the United Kingdom and the commitment of the Westminster government we are able to ensure that money brought in  whether it be from the City of London or from North Sea oil  can be pooled and directed to wherever it is needed most. That is what being in the United Kingdom is all about.;Iain Duncan Smith;government                   10,,,,,,,,,355
Unfortunately  corruption is widespread in government agencies and public enterprises. Our political system promotes nepotism and wasting money. This has undermined our legal system and confidence in the functioning of the state. One of the consequences is that many citizens don't pay their taxes.;Georgios A.

For a good workout  I go to At One Fitness in North Hollywood  where my trainer  Jon Allsop  puts me through it all. I like it because it's a small gym and I've known the people for a long time.

In giving us children  God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else's sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child's interests first.

So I go to my first book signing  and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: '10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He's a lawyer.'

Today when I think about diversity  I actually think about the word 'inclusion.' And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It's not men  it's not women alone.

'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era ' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane  provides moments of buzzy fun  but it'll leave you only comfortably numb.

My approach to cutting spending as president  is to do a ten percent across the board cut of all federal agencies  and then ask each of my new agency heads to find another ten percent by drilling down. That's what you do in business to come up with approximately 20 percent cuts for the first fiscal year budget.;Herman Cain;business                    44,,,,,,,,,355
When President Obama entered the White House  the economy was in a free-fall. The auto industry: on its back. The banks: frozen up. More than three million Americans had already lost their jobs.

When I launched the development of the GNU system  I explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom  thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom  then it's a success.

My mom passed away at 41 from diabetes. And I'm 42  thank you. I didn't want to do that to my son. So any time I was at the gym  that thing that helped me do that last squat was my son calling some other woman mommy. And that would just give me that extra oomph to do that last squat. I want to be around for him.;Sherri Shepherd;mom                    50,,,,,,,,,355

There are a lot of people who consider themselves 'spiritual ' but that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. I don't really talk about it that often  because there's too much talk in the world. Especially with Christians  there's more proselytizing than there is actual living proof of it.

The American people I talk to don't spend every moment thinking  'How can I tax my neighbor more than they're being taxed?' They say  'How can I get a good job? How can my kids get good jobs?

It's not a matter of if economies around the world becoming low-carbon  but when and how: through struggle and strife or through advancement and progressive leadership.

If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym  you're missing the point completely.

The future is too interesting and dangerous to be entrusted to any predictable  reliable agency. We need all the fallibility we can get.

I think women as well as men are concerned about jobs and the economy and spending and  and other issues.

I auditioned for a solo in church and got it. I was about seven and I sang a song called  'Jesus  I Heard You Had a Big House' and I remember people standing up at the end and me thinking  'Oh  I think I'm going to like this.'

You need to know what makes artists tick. Having been through the process myself as a musician  since I was an early teen  gave me an advantage - understanding them from their point of view  because it's about them  it's not about you - it's their vision and what they're capable of achieving  and you're the conduit.;Tommy Mottola;teen                 94,,,,,,,,,355
I was interested in transcendence from a very early age. I was interested in what was over there  what was behind life. So when I had my first communion I was very disappointed.

If you travel around America you see different sections of highways donated by this or that person  and that's a slow beginning of what may end up being a situation common in the Third World: some sections of highways in wealthy areas are beautifully maintained and other parts are just dirt-strewn potholes.;Robert D.

When I began to choreograph and find my way pulling other artists' dreams out and changing music in a visual way  there was still a part of me that had something more to say.

My late wife Olympia was Goan and I've been to India many times. I love the food there.

There is the expression of selfishness and there is the expression of selflessness - but economists or theoreticians never touched that part. They said: 'Go and become a philanthropist.'

I can't say I'm not grateful to have journalists writing about me as a genius. But I know it's not true. I'm not confused.

My store  Wine Library  outsells big national chains. How do you think we do it? It started with hustle.

And you know  whether it's drama or comedy  the best work is based on truth. It's just that  with comedy  the circumstances are just crazy-heightened  and you have these crazy things thrown at you.

Within our culture  every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf.

I've never really broken this down before  but  in movies  you almost have no connection to fans. And if you do TV  you're kind of connected  but they know you as the TV name not your real name.

When Christians start thinking about Jesus  things start breaking down  they lose their faith. It's perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions  just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they'll lose their Christ  the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;fear                  42,,,,,,,,,356
I spent my whole life in the private sector  25 years in the private sector. I understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people  it makes it more difficult for them to buy things. If they can't buy things  the economy doesn't grow. If the economy doesn't grow  we don't put Americans to work.;Mitt Romney;life                  43,,,,,,,,,356

No one wants to go back to a situation where  if you have a pre-existing medical condition  you  you can be deprived of coverage. No one wants to go back to a situation where  if you get seriously ill  you can get thrown off your insurance.

In the richest country in the history of the world  this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4 0  but health insurance premiums are higher  food prices are higher  utility bills are higher  and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before.;Mitt Romney;history                50,,,,,,,,,356
The Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again  Lord. They've taken your Bible away from the schools. They've forbidden little children to pray. They've taken the knowledge of God as best they can  and organizations have come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of America.;Pat Robertson;knowledge                    54,,,,,,,,,356
A smartphone links patients' bodies and doctors' computers  which in turn are connected to the Internet  which in turn is connected to any smartphone anywhere.

They said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics  to take on public-sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy. But with bipartisan leadership  we saved taxpayers $132 billion dollars over 30 years and saved retirees their pensions. We did it.;Chris Christie;politics                    63,,,,,,,,,356
'Howard the Duck!' That's a really interesting movie. I appreciate my career  because I've had a lot of very interesting ups and downs  and most people... That movie is such a famous flop. In a land of a lot of flops  it's kind of awesome to be in a really famous flop. I mean  it's kind of a poster child for flops.;Lea Thompson;famous                  76,,,,,,,,,356
I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves  and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can  it's so unnatural for me to do it on television  in interviews  in anything like that. I also don't find that my process as an actor is really anyone else's business.;Kristen Stewart;business                  90,,,,,,,,,356
It's very difficult today for girls to become supermodels. There is a lot more competition  a lot of countries in the East have opened up so there are many more models than there were in the Nineties. Now they have to compete with famous actresses but also with  say  reality stars to be on the magazine covers.;Claudia Schiffer;famous                   90,,,,,,,,,356
Can I just say here how much I hate the word 'pamper'? While pretending to celebrate and indulge women  it actually implies that their bodies are so revolting that even their 'me time' must be dedicated to turning them into living dolls if potential suitors are to be prevented from running screaming in horror.;Julie Burchill;women                     102,,,,,,,,,356
I think we are all interested in end-times ideas and also in the current climate that we are all living in  where money is a little harder to come by  things continue to get expensive gas prices are not too far from people's heads.

We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war  a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.

My advice to an aspiring actor would be to never stop learning or working for what you want. Nothing comes easy  ever  if you want something  you have to work for it. By working for it I mean work on your craft  learn from people who have something to teach.

We were probably the last people in the country to get a VCR and we didn't have cable. There wasn't any admiration of glamour  no  'I want to look like them or have that lifestyle'  because everyone in my town had the same lifestyle. So I didn't think  'Ooh  a movie star's birthday!' I just thought  'What?';Christina Hendricks;birthday                125,,,,,,,,,356
I respect country music because I feel like it's more about the talent and the songwriting and I put on a big show and we have a lot of stuff  but I feel confident in myself enough as an artist and a singer that I can have all of those fun toys and know that we don't need all the bells and whistles either.;Carrie Underwood;respect                     141,,,,,,,,,356
Our laws governing lobbying and campaign contributions have struck the right balance between the wishes of the people and those of private industry  so why are we so quick to doubt that the same great results can be achieved by putting the government's justice-dealing branch on the same market-based course?;Thomas Frank;government                     147,,,,,,,,,356
Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent  sophisticated audiences in history.

It's far too much to say that effective hoping is the only - or even the biggest - part of what it takes to succeed. If 14% of business productivity can be attributed to hope  that means 86% is dependent on raw talent  fickle business cycles  the quality of the product you're selling  and often pure  dumb luck.;Jeffrey Kluger;business                 174,,,,,,,,,356
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations  all pride  all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death  leaving only what is truly important.;Steve Jobs;death                   178,,,,,,,,,356
Perhaps the most effective way to describe the approach a brand must take is to think of themselves as social cartographers. By that I mean that brands must simultaneously inspire  engage and maintain a series of conversations taking place within certain cultural landscape specific to their business goal.;Simon Mainwaring;business                     179,,,,,,,,,356
More brands are waking up to their social responsibility and doing good work through cause marketing campaigns. Yet too many still go about it the wrong way. I mean 'wrong' in two senses. Firstly  they are marketing ineffectively  and secondly  as a consequence their positive social impact is not maximized.;Simon Mainwaring;positive                   195,,,,,,,,,356
You can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

I don't stop. It's my nature. People have to tell me to slow down. I plan on playing every role on Broadway. I want to do 'Evita.' I want to do 'Sweeney Todd' with Chris Colfer.

You don't have any communication between the Israelis and the Iranians. You have all sorts of local triggers for conflict. Having countries act on a hair trigger - where they can't afford to be second to strike - the potential for a miscalculation or a nuclear war through inadvertence is simply too high.;Dennis Ross;communication                      331,,,,,,,,,356
I hear the way people talk about the children of famous people. They're not treated very well. The presumptions are usually quite awful. So I tried to establish myself with a couple of movies.

Over the last half century the television interview has given us some of TV's most heart-stopping and memorable moments. On the surface it is a simple format - two people sitting across from one another having a conversation.

I think human society for tens of thousands of years has sent young men out in small groups to do things that are necessary but very dangerous. And they've always gotten killed doing it.

Now  let me be clear. The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle to grave assurance that government will always be the solution.

Well  Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I've ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range  amazing emotional power in his voice. And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have  and he passed at a very young age.;John Legend;age                   4,,,,,,,,,357
You know  it's ironic to me that Christians want to keep the Ten Commandments in our schools  because Christianity has abrogated four of the Ten Commandments. For example  the Sabbath day according to the Ten Commandments is Saturday  not Sunday. And the reason is because God rested  not because Jesus was resurrected.;Alan Dershowitz;god                 8,,,,,,,,,357
At school  there was an annual school disco and I'd be standing in my bedroom wondering what to wear for hours on end.

Imagination  it turns out  is a great deal like reporting in your own head. Here is a paradox of fiction-writing. You are crafting something from nothing  which means  in one sense  that none of it is true.

A couple days ago  I saw a lot of people tweeting  'Oh  it's so cool 'Home' is being used in the Olympics!'

My parents were really  really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug.

You look at the steamboat  the railroad  the car  the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world  but they were popularized and extended by it.

People ask me all the time  'Are you fed up with reality TV?' At the end of the day  it can affect my career in the sense that the more reality shows there are  the less scripted dramas out there  but I can't ever really knock them.

Positive rights are the right to shelter  the right to education  the right to health care  the right to a living wage.

I first fell in love with music when I was a little boy. When I first heard music  I felt the beauty in it.

Laurence Olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts  and the other way around. Because in a comedy you look for what's serious.

Flexible working is not just for women with children. It is necessary at the other end of the scale. If people can move into part-time work  instead of retirement  then that will be a huge help.

All I ever wanted really  and continue to want out of life  is to give 100 percent to whatever I'm doing and to be committed to whatever I'm doing and then let the results speak for themselves. Also to never take myself or people for granted and always be thankful and grateful to the people who helped me.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;thankful                    24,,,,,,,,,358
I should just put it bluntly  because we're all sort of friends here now - it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. Oh  so Jesus  what a thought! You know that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning  and I don't want to go there.;Elizabeth Gilbert;morning                  28,,,,,,,,,358

So I go to my first book signing  and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: '10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He's a lawyer.' He didn't know what was going on. He didn't even know me. They called him  and he came down and asked me out that day. Now I'm dating their dad!;Hoda Kotb;dating                    32,,,,,,,,,358
When you sing with a group of people  you learn how to subsume yourself into a group consciousness because a capella singing is all about the immersion of the self into the community. That's one of the great feelings - to stop being me for a little while and to become us. That way lies empathy  the great social virtue.;Brian Eno;great                    36,,,,,,,,,358
Whether you were talking about Pillsbury  Burger King  Godfather's  the National Restaurant Association  in each one of those situations  I had a daunting problem that I had to solve. And I used the same business principles to approach the problem and  more importantly  solve the problem in every one of the situations.;Herman Cain;business               40,,,,,,,,,358
London in the '70s was a pretty catastrophic dump  I can tell you. We had every kind of industrial trouble we had severe energy problems we were under constant terrorist attack from Irish terrorist groups who started a bombing campaign in English cities politics were fantastically polarized between left and right.;Ian Mcewan;politics                     49,,,,,,,,,358
This is the greatest society in all of human history  the greatest country ever. Many of the decisions being made in Washington today by both parties are threatening that greatness. And if we stay on this road we're on right now  our children are going to be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.;Marco Rubio;history                    52,,,,,,,,,358
Those golden minutes before you are completely awake  when your mind is just drifting  you have no censorship you are ready to develop any kind of idea. That's when I come up with the best and worst ideas. That is the privilege of being a writer - that you can stay in bed for an hour in the morning and it's work time.;Jo Nesbo;morning                    52,,,,,,,,,358

Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource  and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science  environmental management  government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.;James Buchan;government                   55,,,,,,,,,358
Madonna remains the most visible performer on the planet  as well as one of the wealthiest  but would anyone seriously say that artistic self-development is her primary motivating principle? She is too busy with Kabbalah  fashion merchandising  adoption melodramas  the gym  and ill-starred horseback riding to study art.;Camille Paglia;art                56,,,,,,,,,358
They said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics  to take on public-sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy. But with bipartisan leadership  we saved taxpayers $132 billion dollars over 30 years and saved retirees their pensions. We did it.;Chris Christie;leadership                    63,,,,,,,,,358
Television is such an evolving medium. When you're doing a TV show  it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car  you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working  you work on what is working and you add things that do work.;Chris Pratt;car                   66,,,,,,,,,358
I think people should know more of Africa in terms of its joie de vivre  its feeling for life. In spite of the images that one knows about Africa - the economic poverty  the corruption - there's a joy to living and a happiness in community  living together  in community life  which may be missing here in America.;Youssou N'Dour;happiness                 71,,,,,,,,,358
My grandmother had six kids - one died as an infant - and she was dirt-poor  and all her kids got an education. And my mom grew up poor. And they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness. I wanted to have that like an amulet. Not like armor  but like a magic feather. Like Dumbo's magic feather.;Lucy Alibar;mom                    75,,,,,,,,,358
I believe history will come to view 9/11 as an event on par with November 22 1963  the date on which John F. Kennedy was murdered  cutting short a presidency that was growing ever more promising.

If we are to garner sustained U.S. domestic support for future trade agreements  we have to make sure those Americans who have suffered as a consequence of past agreements have an effective social safety net  adjustment assistance  opportunities for retraining and new job creation that enables all Americans to thrive.;Susan Rice;future                   79,,,,,,,,,358
I used to skip out of high school and go flying. It was just one of those things  I thought it was kind of a cool thing to do. I never thought about doing that as a profession  but I started checking things out and I found out there was a flight school down in Daytona Beach  called Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.;Jerry Doyle;cool                   80,,,,,,,,,358
I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life  and it's myself at eight. Because that's when the forces of imagination have the same value as the real world  when they're an instrument of survival: when my mother disappeared  and I imagined a mother. That was me at my best.;Henning Mankell;imagination                   80,,,,,,,,,358
If you tell God no because He won't explain the reason He wants you to do something  you are actually hindering His blessing. But when you say yes to Him  all of heaven opens to pour out His goodness and reward your obedience. What matters more than material blessings are the things He is teaching us in our spirit.;Charles Stanley;god                    83,,,,,,,,,358
Some people just use beautiful things to just shop or to have a tribal feeling - 'Oh  blah  blah  blah  I'm wearing Hermes blah  blah  blah  I'm wearing Saint Laurent blah-blah blah' - because it's like a need  a tribe  recognition: 'Ahh  my Rolex.' But I run away from anything which is too recognizable - it's my nature.;Manolo Blahnik;nature            84,,,,,,,,,358
The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation  and the great goal of the conservative movement  as it rose to triumph in the 1980s  was to remove that threat - to keep OSHA  the EPA  and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace.;Thomas Frank;fear                 89,,,,,,,,,358
I try to respect the rules of the silent movies and I tried to make signification to make sense  and also the crew were very good and the fact that we shot in LA in the real Hollywood  studios and houses. We shot in the bed of Mary Pickford  and you cannot be any more accurate than that  so that helped a lot.;Michel Hazanavicius;respect                  95,,,,,,,,,358
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful  but I've seen quite a few deaths  and  with one exception  I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean  how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.;Lewis Thomas;fear                 98,,,,,,,,,358
And that's really what's happening in this country is a violation of the First Commandment. We have become a country entrenched in idolatry  and that idolatry is the dependency upon our government. We're supposed to depend upon God for our protection and our provision and for our daily bread  not for our government.;Sharron Angle;god                    139,,,,,,,,,358
What people forget is that the most radical thing about Obama is that he was the first black man in history to imagine that he could become president  who was able to make other Americans believe it as well. Other than that  he is a centrist  just like I try to be. He's been bridging divisions his whole life.;Henry Louis Gates;history                   149,,,,,,,,,358
Making movies is not rocket science. It's about relationships and communication and strangers coming together to see if they can get along harmoniously  productively  and creatively. That's a challenge. When it works  it's fantastic and will lift you up. When it doesn't work  it's almost just as fascinating.;Julia Roberts;communication                  151,,,,,,,,,358
Hurtling the Pentagon into an unprecedented budgetary meltdown is horrifically irresponsible. Obama doesn't care. This is war - not against the Taliban  but war against the GOP. He has Republicans on the ropes  and that's a victory he savors and desires - unlike Afghanistan  where he seems only to want to turn tail.;John Podhoretz;war                   151,,,,,,,,,358
America is an idea. And it's the solemn responsibility of each 'temporary' president to protect and nurture that noblest of all ideas - with integrity. This man  Mitt Romney  has shown - not through his experience  but through his actions and words - that he is unqualified to carry out that responsibility.;Jennifer Granholm;experience                   160,,,,,,,,,358
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations  all pride  all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death  leaving only what is truly important.;Steve Jobs;failure                   178,,,,,,,,,358
I've never been much of a computer guy at least in terms of playing with computers. Actually until I was about 11 I didn't use a computer for preparing for games at all. I was playing a bit online  was using the chess club mainly. Now  obviously  the computer is an important tool for me preparing for my games.;Magnus Carlsen;computers                   196,,,,,,,,,358
Filming 'Eclipse' - Eclipse was my favorite book so I was really excited to start filming the movie. I just love that it's the height of the love triangle. 'Twilight' develops Edward and Bella's relationship  'New Moon' develops Jacob and Bella's and in 'Eclipse ' the three of them are physically together.;Taylor Lautner;relationship                    207,,,,,,,,,358
It's fantastic to strive towards a nice life where you eat nice organic food and your children go to a nice school and you can afford nice clothes and nice perfume and the hypoallergenic make-up. But there's never a day goes by  and I mean this from the bottom of my heart  that I don't think about where I'm from.;Samantha Morton;food                    227,,,,,,,,,358
Do you remember when you were 10 or 11 years old and you really thought your folks were the best? They were completely omniscient and you took their word for everything. And then you got older and you went through this hideous age when suddenly they were the devil  they were bullies  and they didn't know anything.;Chuck Palahniuk;age                    264,,,,,,,,,358
One of the things I've started doing lately is tracking my dreams. I feel like there's a lot of information there and you can really bring those emotions to the situations that may feel mundane or familiar. That gives them new life and gives you a new relationship with it - if that makes any sort of sense.;Jennifer Carpenter;dreams                      333,,,,,,,,,358
The soles of Neil Armstrong's boots on the moon made permanent impressions on our souls and in our national psyche. Ann and I watched those steps together on her parent's sofa.

Students never think it can be the teacher's fault and so I thought I was stupid. I was frustrated and would come home and cry because I couldn't do it. Then we got a new teacher who made math accessible. That made all the difference and I learned that it's how you present it that makes it scary or friendly.;Danica McKellar;teacher                      333,,,,,,,,,358
Well  Toronto  I consider to be the birthplace of my films. I've made three films and this is the third one to premiere here in the same theater on the same day at the same time - they are my audience. They're the people that I think about while I'm writing  directing  and editing. I specifically make movies for them.;Jason Reitman;movies                  4,,,,,,,,,359
Again  you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut  destiny  life  karma  whatever. This approach has never let me down  and it has made all the difference in my life.;Steve Jobs;trust                5,,,,,,,,,359
I would say  stay the hell away from the party scene. Anything you put in front of your goal  and especially something like that  whether it's too much gambling  too much food  too much cold beers on the weekend - anything that you put in front of the prize is going to end up getting in the way and hurting you in the end.;Brad Renfro;food                 11,,,,,,,,,359
If I'm pushed  I'd also have to admit I don't like people with allergies. They just annoy me. There seems to be something far too self-centred about it. 'No thanks  I'm allergic.' Why not just say 'No thanks'? I wasn't asking for your medical history  I was just passing around the nuts. Trying to be friendly  that's all.;Jack Dee;medical                  13,,,,,,,,,359
When I grew up  in Taiwan  the Korean War was seen as a good war  where America protected Asia. It was sort of an extension of World War II. And it was  of course  the peak of the Cold War. People in Taiwan were generally proAmerican. The Korean War made Japan. And then the Vietnam War made Taiwan. There is some truth to that.;Ang Lee;war                 14,,,,,,,,,359
When I was younger  my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working  which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old  so it wasn't just about me. At around the age of 30 there was a stretch where I wasn't working - certainly not on anything I liked  anyway - and I started to do other things.;Kiefer Sutherland;age                  18,,,,,,,,,359
In giving us children  God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else's sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child's interests first. Yet  according to His perfect design  it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.;Charles Stanley;leadership                   21,,,,,,,,,359
This is what I asked for  and in this day and age that's what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age  like Scarlett Johansson  but I just don't get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life.;Lindsay Lohan;age                   24,,,,,,,,,359
When I'm home on a break  I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours  I start getting into this total meditation. It's a feeling few people experience  and that's usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can't force myself. I don't sit down and say I've got to practice.;Eddie Van Halen;experience                   24,,,,,,,,,359
One thing that I feel very  very strongly is that we talk about Islamic countries  Islamic people  Islamic leaders  as either moderates or extremists. It's almost like there are only two categories of Muslims. And actually  that doesn't show respect. It shows lack of understanding of the diversity of Muslim thought.;David Miliband;respect                 26,,,,,,,,,359
I heard on public radio recently  there's a thing called Weed Dating. Singles get together in a garden and weed and then they take turns  they keep matching up with other people. Two people will weed down one row and switch over with two other people. It's in Vermont. I don't think I'd be very good at Weed Dating.;Roy Blount  Jr.;dating                   32,,,,,,,,,359
That's why I like to get out there  and get people to see the other side of Mitt  and know us in a different reflection when you see the family and how funny he is with the boys and with the grandkids.

The right to a quality education is  I believe  the perfect path to bridge the gap between different cultures and to reconcile various civilizations. Without such a right  the values of liberty  justice and equality will have no meaning.

It ain't easy to break out of a mold  but if you do your work  people will ultimately see what you're capable of. Too often  people find it easier to make assumptions and stick with what they believe. They put you in a place and it makes their job easier. The good people constantly search for something different.;Christopher Meloni;work                   36,,,,,,,,,359
I love being on stage. I'm completely  totally relaxed. It's the only time in my life when I know where I am and what's coming next. The other Robert Powell is probably fairly melancholic.

Theaters are always going to be around  and doing fine. With computers and technology  we're becoming more and more secluded from each other. And the movie theater is one of the last places where we can still gather and experience something together. I don't think the desire for that magic will ever go away.;Wolfgang Petersen;computers                    38,,,,,,,,,359
Healthy children are born from healthy  respected  well-nourished and educated mothers and it is imperative that they have a voice in the decisions which affect them.

These technologies can make life easier  can let us touch people we might not otherwise.

Positive rights are the right to shelter  the right to education  the right to health care  the right to a living wage. These things are - these are  I would call them  more properly  political rights rather than positive rights.

The world has changed - through technology  through wine-making techniques  the quality of wine is greater than it's ever been.

Each day as I travel through downtown Tucson  I am amazed at how quickly the most ancient of human behaviors have changed. For as long as there have been Homo sapiens - roughly 200 000 years - people have filled their lives principally with two activities: talking directly with other people  and doing physical things.;Andrew Weil;travel                   44,,,,,,,,,359
Governments that block the aspirations of their people  that steal or are corrupt  that oppress and torture or that deny freedom of expression and human rights should bear in mind that they will find it increasingly hard to escape the judgement of their own people  or where warranted  the reach of international law.;William Hague;freedom                  54,,,,,,,,,359
One of the big changes in politics has been because families  individuals  have felt worried  insecure... worried about the economy  worried about their jobs  worried about their kids' futures... actually the disconnect between the public and media discourse and people's everyday concerns has become bigger not smaller.;Nick Clegg;politics                 60,,,,,,,,,359
I decided to start a medical training program for freelancers  only freelancers. They're the ones who are doing most of the combat reporting. They're taking most of the risks.

Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves  they run about loose  hungering for employment  and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations.

At the root of the shy temperament is a deep fear of social judgment  one so severe it can sometimes be crippling.

The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge  place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace.

Working with Chaplin was very amusing and strange. His films are so funny  but working with him  I found him to be a very serious man. Whereas the films of Hitchcock are macabre  he could be a very funny man to work with  always telling jokes and holding court. Of course  when I worked with Charlie he was getting older.;Tippi Hedren;funny                 73,,,,,,,,,359

What has made America amazing has been the fact that throughout our history  throughout the more than 200 years of our history  there have been men and women of courage who stood up and decided it was more important to look out for the future of their children and their grandchildren than their own political futures.;Scott Walker;women                    75,,,,,,,,,359

I haven't deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact  it's probably been quite the opposite. After the success of The Mask  I wasn't offered all that many blonde bombshell parts  to be honest.

If you create something that is asking for people to respond as they're going to respond  you have to allow them to respond as they're going to respond.

That's just the way the world is.;Charlie Kaufman;business                    88,,,,,,,,,359
The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation  and the great goal of the conservative movement  as it rose to triumph in the 1980s  was to remove that threat - to keep OSHA  the EPA  and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace.;Thomas Frank;death                 89,,,,,,,,,359
I played a lot of sports when I was a kid so I get in that ballgame mindset of being really  really respectful  but at same time saying to yourself  'Don't back down a single inch  hang with these guys if you can.' If they throw it high and tight you have to stand in there  you can't take yourself out of that moment.;Michael Keaton;sports                 91,,,,,,,,,359
I was going to make movies. I was the one in the family who was always rolling the video camera  making movies of my brothers around town  and then screening them for my parents. I still would love to make movies someday... that's something that really means a lot to me  and I know I'll have the chance to do it one day.;Joe Jonas;movies                   95,,,,,,,,,359
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful  but I've seen quite a few deaths  and  with one exception  I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean  how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.;Lewis Thomas;death                 98,,,,,,,,,359
I don't know if this is the kind of retrospective analysis that people are fond of applying to their work or actions  but it feels like I knew I was going to be famous and I knew that an element of that would be traumatic  so that if I could make myself something big and otherworldly  it would be a kind of defence.;Russell Brand;famous                   116,,,,,,,,,359
The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family  their friends  people who should be supportive going  'What are you talking about?' Even just seemingly regular career paths  but if it's not what people expect for you they kind of react funny.;Joan Jett;funny                  126,,,,,,,,,359
The 9-9-9 plan would resuscitate this economy because it replaces the outdated tax code that allows politicians to pick winners and losers  and to provide favors in the form of tax breaks  special exemptions and loopholes. It simplifies the code dramatically: 9% business flat tax  9% personal flat tax  9% sales tax.;Herman Cain;business                  138,,,,,,,,,359
Canadians know that the promise of a recession didn't happen because of anything we did here. If you look at all the causes of the recession  problems in mortgage markets  the problems in the banking sector  the problems in government finance in countries like Greece  none of those problems were in present Canada.;Stephen Harper;finance                  140,,,,,,,,,359
I would love to direct but I feel like directing is a whole separate craft and so I tend to respect it as a separate craft that I would need to study first. So  right now I'm still trying to do certain things as an actor and until I get bored of that or I feel completely fed by that then I'll move into directing.;Michael Ealy;respect                     159,,,,,,,,,359
It was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always 'Little House on the Prairie' - so I always wanted to wear those looks. When I was a child  I wouldn't let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now... whaddaya know  every day I'm in a calico dress  basically  so it's kind of funny.;Chloe Sevigny;mom                  166,,,,,,,,,359
Science and vision are not opposites or even at odds. They need each other. I sometimes hear other startup folks say something along the lines of: 'If entrepreneurship was a science  then anyone could do it.' I'd like to point out that even science is a science  and still very few people can do it  let alone do it well.;Eric Ries;alone                   181,,,,,,,,,359
Let me go over this again on the reclaiming the civil rights movement. People of faith that believe that you have an equal right to justice - that is the essence. And if it's not the essence  then we've been sold a pack of lies. The essence is everyone deserves a shot - the content of character  not the color of skin.;Glenn Beck;faith                    190,,,,,,,,,359
I've come to recognize what I call my 'inside interests.' Telling stories. And helping people tell their stories is a sort of interpersonal gardening. My work at NBC News was to report the news  but in hindsight  I often tried to look for some insight to share that might spark a moment of recognition in a viewer.;Jane Pauley;gardening                    193,,,,,,,,,359
Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.

I'm a writer of faith who worries about the intolerance of religion. I look at the past and fear we haven't learned from it. I believe that humanity is capable of evil as well as great acts of courage and goodness. I have hope.

Do you remember when you were 10 or 11 years old and you really thought your folks were the best? They were completely omniscient and you took their word for everything. And then you got older and you went through this hideous age when suddenly they were the devil  they were bullies  and they didn't know anything.;Chuck Palahniuk;best                    264,,,,,,,,,359
Being a mother is the best thing that ever happened to me. Before you have your first baby you are a girl and then you become a mother. There is no transition into being a woman you literally become a mum and being a mum means you always love someone else more than yourself and it is an unexplainable situation.;Brigitte Nielsen;best                      334,,,,,,,,,359
The Constitution remains brilliant in its overall design and sound with respect to the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers.

I do have a close circle of friends and I am very fortunate to have them as friends. I feel very close to them I think friends are everything in life after your family. You come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise what's the point in life?;Shahrukh Khan;time                      334,,,,,,,,,359
Again  you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut  destiny  life  karma  whatever.

But you know  if you live an affluent lifestyle  there are all types of trappings that are there that you have to be cognizant of  and you've got to try and communicate freely and gain understanding about and then keep moving on  because you know  sometimes lifestyles are chosen for us as opposed to us choosing them.;Julius Erving;movingon                 12,,,,,,,,,360
I'm very at ease  and I like it. I never thought I would be such a family-oriented guy I didn't think that was part of my makeup. But somebody said that as you get older you become the person you always should have been  and I feel that's happening to me. I'm rather surprised at who I am  because I'm actually like my dad!;David Bowie;dad                   16,,,,,,,,,360
The Queen of Crafts herself  Martha Stewart  and I have the same birthday. I prefer to think it's the glue-gun wielding  perfect-tart-producing Martha and not the copper pan-throwing  jail-going Martha. But I suppose if I am going to share a calendar square with some of Martha  I have to share it with all of Martha.;Sloane Crosley;birthday                 27,,,,,,,,,360
Goethe died in 1832. As you know  Goethe was very active in science. In fact  he did some very good scientific work in plant morphology and mineralogy. But he was quite bitter at the way in which many scientists refused to grant him a hearing because he was a poet and therefore  they felt  he couldn't be serious.;Stephen Jay Gould;science                  32,,,,,,,,,360
Theaters are always going to be around  and doing fine. With computers and technology  we're becoming more and more secluded from each other. And the movie theater is one of the last places where we can still gather and experience something together. I don't think the desire for that magic will ever go away.;Wolfgang Petersen;technology                    38,,,,,,,,,360
Positive rights are the right to shelter  the right to education  the right to health care  the right to a living wage. These things are - these are  I would call them  more properly  political rights rather than positive rights.

When Christians start thinking about Jesus  things start breaking down  they lose their faith. It's perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions  just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they'll lose their Christ  the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;religion                  42,,,,,,,,,360
Films for TV have to be much closer to the book  mainly because the objective with a TV movie that translates literature is to get the audience  after seeing this version  to pick up the book and read it themselves. My attitude is that TV can never really be any form of art  because it serves audience expectations.;Michael Haneke;attitude                  47,,,,,,,,,360
I'm an ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation  and one of the children  his wish was to go to the Emmys  so he's going to be my date  along with my husband  and my dad and his girlfriend.

We have the character of an island nation: independent  forthright  passionate in defence of our sovereignty. We can no more change this British sensibility than we can drain the English Channel.

I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss  and I feel like in modern day relationships  and maybe just my own experience  it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together.

At the root of the shy temperament is a deep fear of social judgment  one so severe it can sometimes be crippling. Introverted people don't worry unduly about whether they'll be found wanting  they just find too much socializing exhausting and would prefer either to be alone or in the company of a select few people.;Jeffrey Kluger;alone                    68,,,,,,,,,360
The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge  place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It's been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It's a relationship that has evolved over time  given me the greatest respect and love for the game.;Michael Jordan;peace                    68,,,,,,,,,360
What has made America amazing has been the fact that throughout our history  throughout the more than 200 years of our history  there have been men and women of courage who stood up and decided it was more important to look out for the future of their children and their grandchildren than their own political futures.;Scott Walker;future                    75,,,,,,,,,360
I haven't deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact  it's probably been quite the opposite. After the success of The Mask  I wasn't offered all that many blonde bombshell parts  to be honest.

Autism is a neurological disorder. It's not caused by bad parenting. It's caused by  you know  abnormal development in the brain. The emotional circuits in the brain are abnormal. And there also are differences in the white matter  which is the brain's computer cables that hook up the different brain departments.;Temple Grandin;parenting                   83,,,,,,,,,360
I do what I love to do at the moment. If I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to dance  that's what I'd do. Or design clothes. I think I'd throw myself into whatever I'm doing now. It's not about abandoning what I was doing before  or giving up. It's about knowing that if I die tomorrow  I lived the way I wanted to.;Ayumi Hamasaki;design                   86,,,,,,,,,360
I feel an intense intimacy with those who have this loathing interest in me. Further than this  I know what they mean  I sympathize with them  I understand them. There should be a name (as poetic as love) for this relationship between loather and loathed it is of the closest and more full of passion than incest.;Laura Riding;relationship                   94,,,,,,,,,360
Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air  or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility.

Flexible working is not just for women with children. It is necessary at the other end of the scale. If people can move into part-time work  instead of retirement  then that will be a huge help.

I could have probably raised them in L.A. and they would have been great and had so many things at their fingertips and been exposed to so many things. But we travel a lot  so I don't think that moving out of town is sheltering the girls at all.

In grade school I was taught that the United States is a melting pot. People from all over the world come here for freedom and to pursue a better life.

One nice thing about being a woman in Hollywood is that the women tend to be very close-knit.

Actors are steeped in a world of agents and where the next job is coming from and what are their expenses and what is the hotel like.

The great thing about being a print journalist is that you are permitted to duck. Cameramen get killed while the writers are flat on the floor.

We don't have enough support for maternal leave and the kinds of things that some of the European countries do.

When I grew up  in Taiwan  the Korean War was seen as a good war  where America protected Asia. It was sort of an extension of World War II. And it was  of course  the peak of the Cold War.

A simple compliment goes a really long way - for a guy to just come over and say  'You have great hair' or 'I really like your dress ' and then just smile and walk away.

I also want to get a boat and open a restaurant.;Joe Jonas;movies                   81,,,,,,,,,361
I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it  which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book. But the reality is that organised religion doesn't seem to work. It turns people into hateful lemmings and it's not really compassionate.;Elton John;religion                     83,,,,,,,,,361
President Obama has offered a plan with 4 trillion dollars in debt reduction over a decade  with two and a half dollars of spending reductions for every one dollar of revenue increases  and tight controls on future spending. It's the kind of balanced approach proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.;William J. Clinton;future                    90,,,,,,,,,361
Part of my training was learning how to refer patients to cardiologists for heart problems  gastroenterologists for stomach issues  and rheumatologists for joint pain. Given that most physicians were trained this way  it's no wonder that the average Medicare patient has six doctors and is on five different medications.;Mark Hyman;learning                   90,,,,,,,,,361
Watching the evening news in 2011 is a strange time-travel experience. 'The CBS Evening News ' 'ABC World News' and 'NBC Nightly News' haven't changed their style over the decades  still going for that old-fashioned mix of voice-of-authority pomp and feel-good fluff. The difference is that people aren't watching.;Rob Sheffield;experience                    92,,,,,,,,,361
We're living in a time when parenting is not at all mirroring the way I was parented. For me  I just followed my parents around on their errands when they were busy on the phone  I was quiet. It's a different kettle of fish these days: They run the house  and you listen to their music  and you go to their appointments.;Edie Falco;parenting                  92,,,,,,,,,361
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful  but I've seen quite a few deaths  and  with one exception  I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean  how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.;Lewis Thomas;amazing                 98,,,,,,,,,361
I've been acting my whole life. I have this huge imagination! I'm a dancer and my mom's a dance teacher  and I was always performing and entertaining people. I'd go to see live theatre or a movie  and I'd become the main character for a few days afterwards. I loved being somebody new for a temporary amount of time.;Natasha Calis;teacher                    103,,,,,,,,,361
The irony is that it was tougher to rent a car from Cerberus when it owned Alamo than to buy a semi-automatic. To rent a car  one had to provide ID  a drivers' license  and get insurance coverage. To buy a gun? Cash and carry  from the back of a station wagon at a gun show. No concerns about downstream liability or risk.;Eliot Spitzer;car                  124,,,,,,,,,361
But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders. Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman  you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top  they haven't exactly been non-aggressive - including me.;Madeleine Albright;women                    142,,,,,,,,,361
There is something about the South that accepts the supernatural. If you don't accept it and you're having a conversation with someone who does  it's just one of those polite things where you don't question their belief in ghosts. You just go  'Oh  yeah  okay.' It's amazing to be able to have conversations like that.;Alice Englert;amazing                  143,,,,,,,,,361
In Scotland over many years we have cultivated through our justice system what I hope can be described as a 'culture of compassion.' On the other hand  there still exists in many parts of the U.S.  if not nationally  an attitude towards the concept of justice which can only be described as a 'culture of vengeance.';Keith O'Brien;attitude                   150,,,,,,,,,361
We need to develop and disseminate an entirely new paradigm and practice of collaboration that supersedes the traditional silos that have divided governments  philanthropies and private enterprises for decades and replace it with networks of partnerships working together to create a globally prosperous society.;Simon Mainwaring;society                     157,,,,,,,,,361
In the post-enlightenment Europe of the 19th century the highest authority was no longer the Church. Instead it was science. Thus was born racial anti-Semitism  based on two disciplines regarded as science in their day - the 'scientific study of race' and the Social Darwinism of Herbert Spencer and Ernst Haeckel.;Jonathan Sacks;science                     159,,,,,,,,,361
It was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always 'Little House on the Prairie' - so I always wanted to wear those looks. When I was a child  I wouldn't let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now... whaddaya know  every day I'm in a calico dress  basically  so it's kind of funny.;Chloe Sevigny;funny                  166,,,,,,,,,361
I think it's particularly a distinctively American concept that resonates with American culture through biker culture. A motorcycle is an independent thing. You're like  'I don't want to ride in a car with this person. I want to be independent and ride by myself. But  let's ride in a group. Let's be independent  together.';Ryan Hurst;car                   168,,,,,,,,,361
Wigs have always been a part of my life and have become a staple accessory in my closet. I can remember being a little girl and hearing all the commotion in my house from my mom  aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and part of their everyday beauty routine.;Sherri Shepherd;mom                     177,,,,,,,,,361
Science and vision are not opposites or even at odds. They need each other. I sometimes hear other startup folks say something along the lines of: 'If entrepreneurship was a science  then anyone could do it.' I'd like to point out that even science is a science  and still very few people can do it  let alone do it well.;Eric Ries;science                   181,,,,,,,,,361
The days when the words 'Hollywood actor' framed Ronald Reagan like bunny fingers as an ID tag and an implied insult seem far-off and quaint: nearly everybody in politics - candidate  consultant  pundit  and Tea Party crowd extra alike - is an actor now  a shameless ham in a hoked-up reality series that never stops.;James Wolcott;politics                  182,,,,,,,,,361
I'm noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum's 'Younger Than Jesus' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial  and I'm seeing it blossom and bear fruit at 'Greater New York ' MoMA P.S. 1's twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.;Jerry Saltz;art                    189,,,,,,,,,361
We don't have enough support for maternal leave and the kinds of things that some of the European countries do. So we still make it hard on women to go into the work force and feel that they can be good at work but then doing the most important job  which is raising your children in a responsible and positive way.;Hillary Clinton;women                     248,,,,,,,,,361
The reality of split government puts a premium on creativity within the administration. President Obama needs to put the right people in charge of the agencies and then have them push the bounds of administrative power to change policy through those agencies. President Obama has a pretty good track record of this.;Eliot Spitzer;change                      336,,,,,,,,,361
I do have a close circle of friends and I am very fortunate to have them as friends. I feel very close to them I think friends are everything in life after your family. You come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise what's the point in life?;Shahrukh Khan;family                      336,,,,,,,,,361
I was on the football team because I wanted to experience the different iconic social classes of high school. So football for me was an attempt to socially integrate in an interesting way. And then I didn't like it anymore and stopped doing it and focused more on drama and science and other forms of art and music.;Reggie Watts;science                      336,,,,,,,,,361
Oh  stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look  I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music. It was a singing teacher that thought it would be best for my voice. Then I moved into crossover. And if that makes the music accessible to more people  then great.;Katherine Jenkins;home                   2,,,,,,,,,362
I mean  I was just one of the ones who got exposed  and because of the position I was in  where I was in my life  it went mainstream. A lot of people got out of it after my situation  not because I went to prison but because it was sad for them to see me go through something that was so pointless  that could have been avoided.;Michael Vick;sad                6,,,,,,,,,362
My mother  whom I love dearly  has continually revised my life story within the context of a complicated family history that includes more than the usual share of divorce  step-children  dysfunction  and obfuscation. I've spent most of my adult life attempting to deconstruct that history and separate fact from fiction.;Melissa Gilbert;history                 9,,,,,,,,,362
My family  frankly  they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church  so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.;Barack Obama;life                   9,,,,,,,,,362
But for me  I thought you made a record  you got on a bus  went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there's a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings  late nights  a lot of traveling  a lot of being away from home  being away from your family.;Jason Aldean;home               10,,,,,,,,,362
In reality  Republicans have long been at war with clean energy. They have ridiculed investments in solar and wind power  bashed energy-efficiency standards  attacked state moves to promote renewable energy and championed laws that would enshrine taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels while stripping them from wind and solar.;Jeff Goodell;war                   10,,,,,,,,,362
But on average  I go to the gym about four or five times a week. Today  I'm so experienced in training - I'm actually listening to my body now. My body needs freedom. When I train I create serenity and I produce oxygen in my blood. It helps me to think better and relax.

In a wristwatch  imagine the battery is in the strap and there's a medical sensor in there connected to the internet. If someone is monitoring that  they could phone up if the user has forgotten to take some medication. This could save hundreds of dollars in medical fees later. What's missing? It's a stable battery.;Donald Sadoway;medical                    15,,,,,,,,,362
I used to get nervous  you know if my parents would come watch. And then I would get nervous if my friends came and watched. Today it's not a problem anymore actually  because now I enjoy it.

We judged that a sudden  disorderly failure of Bear would have brought with it unpredictable but severe consequences for the functioning of the broader financial system and the broader economy  with lower equity prices  further downward pressure on home values  and less access to credit for companies and households.;Timothy Geithner;failure                  23,,,,,,,,,362
If terror groups are to be defeated  it is national governments that will have to do so. In nations like India  governments will have to call on the patriotism of citizens to fight the terrorists. In a nation like Pakistan  the government will have to be persuaded to deal with those in their midst who are complicit.;Bill Kristol;patriotism                   35,,,,,,,,,362
Sometimes negative news does come out  but it is often exaggerated and manipulated to spread scandal. Journalists sometimes risk becoming ill from coprophilia and thus fomenting coprophagia: which is a sin that taints all men and women  that is  the tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects.;Pope Francis I;positive                   37,,,,,,,,,362
The most watched programme on the BBC  after the news  is probably 'Doctor Who.' What has happened is that science fiction has been subsumed into modern literature. There are grandparents out there who speak Klingon  who are quite capable of holding down a job. No one would think twice now about a parallel universe.;Terry Pratchett;science                   37,,,,,,,,,362
These technologies can make life easier  can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups  get medical information  the latest experimental drugs.

I was telling somebody just the other day  there's technically such a hierarchy in this business. You have film  that's the ideal then you have TV  and things like web series do not claim as much cred  but the fact is  if the material is solid and I believe and trust in the team that's involved  I don't care what format it is.;Tony Hale;trust                41,,,,,,,,,362
The world has changed - through technology  through wine-making techniques  the quality of wine is greater than it's ever been.

I spent my whole life in the private sector  25 years in the private sector. I understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people  it makes it more difficult for them to buy things. If they can't buy things  the economy doesn't grow. If the economy doesn't grow  we don't put Americans to work.;Mitt Romney;government                  43,,,,,,,,,362
Any time women come together with a collective intention  it's a powerful thing.

As a former football player who has carried a football more than 4 000 times  trust me  I did not go into ballroom dancing with my body being 100 percent  with no aches or pains or ailments coming with me.

The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge  place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace.

The actual truth about Gad is it's one of the original 13 tribes of Israel  so you can actually trace my lineage back to  like  those guys who had  like  a hand in the Bible and have since become very famous from that.

Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was  you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose  which he put on her bedside table.

There's pros and cons of a big church. Cons is I don't get to know everybody  I don't get to go to their ballgame  I don't get to marry everybody  but the pros are you get all this community  800 ushers come in to serve  getting there at 7 in the morning on their day off and coming in on Saturday to make all those wafers.;Joel Osteen;morning                 76,,,,,,,,,362
I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I'm growing as a person of faith  as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life.

The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation  and the great goal of the conservative movement  as it rose to triumph in the 1980s  was to remove that threat - to keep OSHA  the EPA  and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace.;Thomas Frank;business                 89,,,,,,,,,362
Mitt - what I speak to Mitt Romney about is jobs.

I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety.

I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.

The bottom line is how do we best provide for the security of the traveling public in light of a determined enemy who is adept at constructing well-designed  well-concealed devices which would not show up in a walk-through metal detector?

Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident.

The great thing about being a print journalist is that you are permitted to duck. Cameramen get killed while the writers are flat on the floor.

I do not understand how it is that financial institutions could think that they could take taxpayer money and then turn around and act like it's business as usual.

The Supreme Court has never ruled that Congress can use the Commerce Clause to require individuals to engage in an activity they have chosen to avoid.

As musicians and artists  it's important we have an environment - and I guess when I say environment  I really mean the industry  that really nurtures these gifts.

Even in a gleefully negative comic  there is optimism  although it's slightly hidden: It comes out through a comic character's sheer tenacity.

When you're going through something  whether it's a wonderful thing like having a child or a sad thing like losing somebody  you often feel like 'Oh my God  I'm so overwhelmed I'm dealing with this huge thing on my own.'

For every successful actor or actress  there are countless numbers who don't make it. The name of the game is rejection.

While eschewing emotion - and its companion  vulnerability - Obama should be careful not to sacrifice empathy  the 'I feel your pain' connection that sustained Clinton.

I was so lucky to have parents who supported me 100%  with whatever I was doing  both financially and emotionally. Having that they made my life so much easier. Instead of becoming a bartender and trying to survive while trying to pursue your dreams  I didn't have to worry about that aspect. I could just pursue my dreams.;Cam Gigandet;dreams                  47,,,,,,,,,363
I got a family house for everybody to live in - my mom  my sisters and I. And I made sure that it has a separate apartment downstairs for myself. Family is more important than anything. We don't come from any money. So once I get them settled in  in a nice house  then I'll branch out and see if I can get something else.;Vinny Guadagnino;mom                   54,,,,,,,,,363
The business side of film has goofed up so many things  but even that's changing. It happened to the music industry and now it's happening to the film studios. It's crazy what's going on. But artists should have control of their work especially if  as I always say  you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea.;David Lynch;music                   54,,,,,,,,,363
This is a good time to ask apologists for the Islamic regime  who degrades Islam? Who imposes stoning  forced marriage of underage girls and flogging for not wearing the veil? Do such practices represent Iran's ancient history and culture  its ethnic and religious diversity? Its centuries of sensual and subversive poetry?;Azar Nafisi;poetry                   60,,,,,,,,,363
The real truth is that the Obama administration is professional at bullying  as we have witnessed with ACORN at work during the presidential campaign. It seems to me they are sending down their bullies to create fist fights among average American citizens who don't want a government-run health care plan forced upon them.;Jon Voight;health                     75,,,,,,,,,363
I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I'm growing as a person of faith  as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.;J. C. Watts;faith                     81,,,,,,,,,363
Normal people have an incredible lack of empathy. They have good emotional empathy  but they don't have much empathy for the autistic kid who is screaming at the baseball game because he can't stand the sensory overload. Or the autistic kid having a meltdown in the school cafeteria because there's too much stimulation.;Temple Grandin;good                     82,,,,,,,,,363
I don't think it should be a surprise when we're talking about energy and trying to have more home-grown energy  be less reliant on foreign oil when you look at our health care that we're trying to get more affordable health care  that these are going to create major debates in this country and be somewhat polarizing.;Amy Klobuchar;health                    111,,,,,,,,,363
There's only one thing harder than living in a home with an adolescent - and that's being an adolescent. The moodiness  the volatility  the wholesale lack of impulse control  all would be close to clinical conditions if they occurred at another point in life. In adolescence  they're just part of the behavioral portfolio.;Jeffrey Kluger;home                  118,,,,,,,,,363
I would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy. Bring it back to 20 percent or lower. And say  we are not going to spend above that level. Democrats  they want to raise your taxes and spend more and more and turn us into an economy which is no longer driven by the private sector.;Mitt Romney;government                    130,,,,,,,,,363
The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor  I'm just gonna tell her  'Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because they'll have to hire you  they can't really fire you  and you don't have to produce that much. It'll be awesome.';Adam Carolla;funny                  142,,,,,,,,,363

Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque. But just doing it - being in your room for years on end  locked in your head  alone with invented ghosts - it weakens and softens the body. And I know I can't just live in my head.;Tony Parsons;alone                    196,,,,,,,,,363
I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents we're all teachers - if we're willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn  trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door.;Marla Gibbs;trust                     204,,,,,,,,,363
The thing about youthful offenders is that no one seems to care about them. Most people don't like adolescents - even the good ones can be snarky and unpleasant. Combine the antipathy we feel toward the average teenager with the fear inspired by youth violence  and you have a population that no one wants to deal with.;Ayelet Waldman;fear                     260,,,,,,,,,363
I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet  lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy.;Andrew Weil;diet                     267,,,,,,,,,363
To a considerable extent we are faced by a technology arms race with terrorists. The communications revolution has made it easier for terrorist groups to reach out to vulnerable individuals with their violent extremist ideology and propaganda. It has also facilitated fundraising  recruitment and training.;Pauline Neville-Jones;technology                     279,,,,,,,,,363
We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year's car would have even if it's small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.;Jenson Button;car                      338,,,,,,,,,363
Imagine if the pension funds and endowments that own much of the equity in our financial services companies demanded that those companies revisit the way mortgages were marketed to those without adequate skills to understand the products they were being sold. Management would have to change the way things were done.;Eliot Spitzer;change                      338,,,,,,,,,363
But America was founded on the principle that every person has God-given rights. That power belongs to the people. That government exists to protect our rights and serve our interests.That we shouldn't be trapped in the circumstances of our birth. That we should be free to go as far as our talents and work can take us.;Marco Rubio;power                      338,,,,,,,,,363
Now  let me be clear. The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle to grave assurance that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise the most goodies and the most benefits  I'm not your president. You have that president today.;Mitt Romney;government                    3,,,,,,,,,364
Labor  under their current leadership  want to be the Downtown Abbey party when it comes to educational opportunity. They think working class children should stick to the station in life they were born into - they should be happy to be recognized for being good with their hands and not presume to get above themselves.;Michael Gove;leadership                    5,,,,,,,,,364
My family  frankly  they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church  so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.;Barack Obama;family                   9,,,,,,,,,364
But for me  I thought you made a record  you got on a bus  went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there's a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings  late nights  a lot of traveling  a lot of being away from home  being away from your family.;Jason Aldean;family               10,,,,,,,,,364
In reality  Republicans have long been at war with clean energy. They have ridiculed investments in solar and wind power  bashed energy-efficiency standards  attacked state moves to promote renewable energy and championed laws that would enshrine taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels while stripping them from wind and solar.;Jeff Goodell;power                   10,,,,,,,,,364
When I was younger  I wasn't concentrating on good days. I was managing a career and trying to have a good year. It would always 'lead' to something  which never leads to anything except death  where everything leads to. And then as I got older  and then I had my kids and everything  I began to appreciate a great Wednesday.;Albert Brooks;death                 18,,,,,,,,,364
I was 20 years old  working as a roofer and a telemarketer and driving a taxi  just barely getting by. A friend of a friend suggested I try acting. I was like  'Why? What am I going to do? Community theater?' But I took a class  and the teacher thought that I had potential  so I moved to Vancouver and started auditioning.;Cory Monteith;teacher                 18,,,,,,,,,364
And when I was young  my family was perfectly nice. I write a lot about it  as you noticed. But it was rather limited. I think  I don't think anyone in my family would really feel I'd done them an injustice by saying that. We didn't see many people. There were many books. It was as if I wanted to get away from home.;Christopher Hitchens;home                   20,,,,,,,,,364
As musicians and artists  it's important we have an environment - and I guess when I say environment  I really mean the industry  that really nurtures these gifts. Oftentimes  the machine can overlook the need to take care of the people who produce the sounds that have a lot to do with the health and well-being of society.;Lauryn Hill;society                  24,,,,,,,,,364
People are roasting each other at parties  at work events  around the fire. It's so fun. People are busting each other's chops  and it's a sign of affection  truly. It's a true test of love and friendship: can you make a man laugh at himself? So what makes a good burn? Go after targets you love and respect. And hit 'em hard.;Jeff Ross;respect                  41,,,,,,,,,364
To understand the intensity of driving an F1 car  you have to be in it. When you're driving a 750hp machine at 200mph  the noise and the vibrations are incredible. The G-force when you take big corners is like someone trying to rip your head off. You hit the brakes  and it feels as if the skin is being pulled off your body.;Jenson Button;car                   48,,,,,,,,,364
The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like  although that was part of it. Primarily  it was how it worked. To design something really well  you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something  chew it up  not just quickly swallow it.;Steve Jobs;design                 48,,,,,,,,,364
If I am elected President of these United States  I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America  to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it  our nation depends upon it  the peace and freedom of the world require it.;Mitt Romney;work                  48,,,,,,,,,364
Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is  closely examine why you feel that way. You may discover that this attitude has been forced upon you by mass media and the crass culture it creates and maintains. The fact is  gardening is just the opposite - it is  or should be  a central  basic expression of human life.;Andrew Weil;attitude                 51,,,,,,,,,364
It's tough because a lot of my friends in normal life  a lot of my friends in the entertainment business  and a lot of my friends in the wrestling business are gay. Just to say something spiteful and hurtful  I don't get it... if it was true and I was gay  I'd embrace it  and I'd tell you guys about it and I'd celebrate it.;Hulk Hogan;business                 53,,,,,,,,,364
I would argue that we have a generation of young people  particularly minorities  who are no longer putting up with the kinds of things their parents put up with. They're much more self-confident. It's no longer acceptable to make fun of people because of race or sex. But it has always been present in American society.;Donna Shalala;society                    55,,,,,,,,,364
In thinking about religion and society in the 21st century  we should broaden the conversation about faith from doctrinal debates to the larger question of how it might inspire us to strengthen the bonds of belonging that redeem us from our solitude  helping us to construct together a gracious and generous social order.;Jonathan Sacks;faith                    58,,,,,,,,,364

Automation and technology would be a great boon if it were creative  if there were more leisure  more opportunity to engage in raising a family  providing guidance to the young  all the stuff we say we need. America will work if we're all in it together. It'll work when there's a shared sense of destiny. It can be done!;Jerry Brown;technology                  67,,,,,,,,,364
We need to drive down requirements for the schools. In the 19th century  we increased the quality of the schools by higher education saying  'You can't come in unless you have these skills  unless you've taken these courses.' We did that in Wisconsin when I was there  it helped to transform the secondary school system.;Donna Shalala;education                  71,,,,,,,,,364
Over the past 50 years we got versions of X-ray specs and space vacations  and even death rays. But the X-ray specs don't fit on your face - they're big things that screen your luggage for guns. Space vacations are real  but they cost $20 million. We have death rays  but you have to be a triple Ph.D. to play with them.;Daniel H. Wilson;death                   73,,,,,,,,,364
The Founders recognized that Government is quite literally a necessary evil  that there must be opposition  between its various branches  and between political parties  for these are the only ways to temper the individual's greed for power and the electorates' desires for peace by submission to coercion or blandishment.;David Mamet;government                  75,,,,,,,,,364
My grandmother had six kids - one died as an infant - and she was dirt-poor  and all her kids got an education. And my mom grew up poor. And they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness. I wanted to have that like an amulet. Not like armor  but like a magic feather. Like Dumbo's magic feather.;Lucy Alibar;happiness                    75,,,,,,,,,364
Accuracy is paramount in every detail of a work of history. Here's my rule: Ask yourself  'Did this thing happen?' If the answer is yes  then it's historical. Then ask  'Did this thing happen precisely this way?' If the answer is yes  then it's history if the answer is no  not precisely this way  then it's historical drama.;Tony Kushner;history                88,,,,,,,,,364
Those in the west who dismiss the repressiveness of laws against women in countries like Iran  no matter how benign their intentions  present a condescending view not just of the religion but also of women living in Muslim majority countries  as if the desire for choice and happiness is the monopoly of women in the west.;Azar Nafisi;religion                   93,,,,,,,,,364
I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up  I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself.;Cameron Diaz;age                     98,,,,,,,,,364
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful  but I've seen quite a few deaths  and  with one exception  I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean  how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.;Lewis Thomas;experience                 98,,,,,,,,,364
Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family  but they're also building an image and identity for themselves  which in a sense is their brand. They're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It's almost a disadvantage if you're not on it now.;Mark Zuckerberg;family                    101,,,,,,,,,364
I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now  maybe things would happen for me  but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians  12 dancers  two major guest stars  50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.;Carol Burnett;money                 103,,,,,,,,,364
What we're doing now is we're saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities  so that head teachers can decide what's truly important  because the big shift in approach on education that we're taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;trust                    104,,,,,,,,,364
Singing is a way of releasing an emotion that you sometimes can't portray when you're acting. And music moves your soul  so music is the source of the most intense emotions you can feel. When you hear a song and you're acting it's incredible. But when you're singing a song and you're acting it's even more incredible.;Amanda Seyfried;music                     119,,,,,,,,,364
We worry about the seemingly ever-increasing number of natural catastrophes. Yet this is mainly a consequence of CNN - we see many more  but the number is roughly constant  and we manage to deal much better with them over time. Globally  the death rate from catastrophes has dropped about fifty-fold over the past century.;Bjorn Lomborg;death                   135,,,,,,,,,364
People find themselves in ruts all the time. You're in a complacent lifestyle where you work 9 to 5 and then you add a mortgage and kids. You feel trapped  but guess what  brother? You constructed that life. If you're OK with it  there's nothing wrong with that. But if you've got unease  then you've got to make a change.;Jeremy Renner;change                  154,,,,,,,,,364
Actresses can get outrageously precious about the way they look. That's not what life's about. If you starve yourself to the point where your brain cells shrivel  you will never do good work. And if you're overly conscious of your arms flapping in the wind  how can you look the other actor in the eye to respond to them?;Cate Blanchett;work                    161,,,,,,,,,364
Wigs have always been a part of my life and have become a staple accessory in my closet. I can remember being a little girl and hearing all the commotion in my house from my mom  aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and part of their everyday beauty routine.;Sherri Shepherd;beauty                     177,,,,,,,,,364
Some have called we rock and roll performers who never retire 'troubadours.' I enjoy this misnomer immensely. While there are many differences between me and my distant predecessors in L'Occitane  I do believe there is a lineage that connects us of the last 70 years with those romantic singers of the High Middle Ages.;Frank Black;romantic                     195,,,,,,,,,364
I don't feel I was ever a 'famous' child actor. I was just a working actor who happened to be a kid. I was never really in a hit show until I was a teenager with West Wing playing First Daughter Zoey Bartlet. In a way  that was my saving grace - not being a star on a hit show. It kept me working and kept me grounded.;Elizabeth Moss;famous                     217,,,,,,,,,364
My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war  but to all other factors that threaten peace  such as discrimination  such as inequality  poverty.;Aung San Suu Kyi;war                  222,,,,,,,,,364
My sister and I shared a bedroom our entire lives and I believe she discovered the Beatles when she was about 11 and I'm four years younger. So from the age of 7 until 17 we had nothing but Beatles paraphernalia in our room  even those little stuffed Beatles that went on stands that are dressed as the Sgt. Pepper band.;Christina Ricci;age                     223,,,,,,,,,364
We don't have enough support for maternal leave and the kinds of things that some of the European countries do. So we still make it hard on women to go into the work force and feel that they can be good at work but then doing the most important job  which is raising your children in a responsible and positive way.;Hillary Clinton;positive                     248,,,,,,,,,364
Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell.

We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff.

One of the things I've started doing lately is tracking my dreams. I feel like there's a lot of information there and you can really bring those emotions to the situations that may feel mundane or familiar. That gives them new life and gives you a new relationship with it - if that makes any sort of sense.;Jennifer Carpenter;relationship                      339,,,,,,,,,364
Oh  stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look  I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music. It was a singing teacher that thought it would be best for my voice. Then I moved into crossover. And if that makes the music accessible to more people  then great.;Katherine Jenkins;teacher                   2,,,,,,,,,365
And  you know  being able to wear the stars and stripes  when you step up on one of the blocks or  you know  when you step off of an airplane or when you hear the national anthem play  you know  it's one of the greatest feelings in the world because you know that there are people at home who are supporting you and watching you.;Michael Phelps;home               3,,,,,,,,,365
Well  you got to remember  bin Laden killed 3 000 Americans and  in some ways  he and his ideology killed tens of thousands of his fellow Muslims  including Pakistanis.

Well  in our industry it's that the movies cost so much money to make they have to appeal to a broad audience. And I think that's part of what will loosen up in the future  as technology makes it cheaper  you'll be able to make films for a more selective audience. I think people will be able to make more personal movies.;Chris Wedge;technology                   4,,,,,,,,,365
To me  what I love about the draft is first  you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they've worked so hard for. That's a pretty cool thing. You saw the emotion from some of these guys the other day. And then  the second thing is this total sense of hope and optimism. And  I think that's great for everybody.;Roger Goodell;cool                  5,,,,,,,,,365

I think  in a way  I invented the term 'fight club' and that these things have always existed  but they never really had a label. Nobody had a language to apply to them.

You know  out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy  but in everything they do  they show they don't like business very much. But the economy  of course  is simply the product of all the businesses of the nation added together. So it's a bit like saying you like an omelet  but you don't like eggs.;Mitt Romney;business                8,,,,,,,,,365
Corporations  consumers  and citizens must begin acting in concert to create a powerful third pillar of social transformation if we hope to meet the social challenges we currently face with equal force.

Thanks to capitalism  the importance placed on beauty has never been so manipulated. We are the guinea pigs force-fed ads that tell us how pathetic we are: that we will never be loved  happy or valuable unless we have the body  the face  the hair  even the personality that will apparently be ours  if only we buy their products.;Beth Ditto;beauty                20,,,,,,,,,365
And across Afghanistan  every single day  Afghan soldiers  Afghan police and ISAF troops are serving shoulder-to-shoulder in some very difficult situations.

For all their current prestige  Osama bin Laden and the suicide bombers are still regarded in all but the most desperate districts of Gaza or Peshawar as romantics with little chance of more than symbolic victories  however bloody and brutal. That gives both the Middle East and the West a small and distant hope of security.;James Buchan;hope                    30,,,,,,,,,365
Anyone could be in the orchestra  or sports team  or arts club at my school. It was precisely the kind of inclusivity that now meets with a sort of scorn and derision as a prizes-for-all culture that generates only mediocrity. There's something so insulting about the idea that including lots of people means mediocrity.;Elizabeth Price;sports                    32,,,,,,,,,365
If I am elected President of these United States  I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America  to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it  our nation depends upon it  the peace and freedom of the world require it.;Mitt Romney;peace                  48,,,,,,,,,365
Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is  closely examine why you feel that way. You may discover that this attitude has been forced upon you by mass media and the crass culture it creates and maintains. The fact is  gardening is just the opposite - it is  or should be  a central  basic expression of human life.;Andrew Weil;gardening                 51,,,,,,,,,365
This is a good time to ask apologists for the Islamic regime  who degrades Islam? Who imposes stoning  forced marriage of underage girls and flogging for not wearing the veil? Do such practices represent Iran's ancient history and culture  its ethnic and religious diversity? Its centuries of sensual and subversive poetry?;Azar Nafisi;marriage                   60,,,,,,,,,365
Now that virtually every career is an option for ambitious girls  it can no longer be considered regressive or reactionary to reintroduce discussion of marriage and motherhood to primary education. We certainly do not want to return to the simplistic duality of home economics classes for girls and wood shop for boys.;Camille Paglia;marriage                     64,,,,,,,,,365
Those in the west who dismiss the repressiveness of laws against women in countries like Iran  no matter how benign their intentions  present a condescending view not just of the religion but also of women living in Muslim majority countries  as if the desire for choice and happiness is the monopoly of women in the west.;Azar Nafisi;happiness                   93,,,,,,,,,365
I've been acting my whole life. I have this huge imagination! I'm a dancer and my mom's a dance teacher  and I was always performing and entertaining people. I'd go to see live theatre or a movie  and I'd become the main character for a few days afterwards. I loved being somebody new for a temporary amount of time.;Natasha Calis;imagination                    103,,,,,,,,,365
I've been keeping a diary for thirty-three years and write in it every morning. Most of it's just whining  but every so often there'll be something I can use later: a joke  a description  a quote. It's an invaluable aid when it comes to winning arguments. 'That's not what you said on February 3 1996 ' I'll say to someone.;David Sedaris;morning                 105,,,,,,,,,365
I had a couple of movies that I was passionately involved with that I could never get made. 'Richard Pryor ' I wrote for - gosh - over a year. That was close to getting made for two-and-a-half years after that. We're still pushing it  you know. It is weird. Suddenly you wake up and it's like  'God  five years have gone by.';Bill Condon;movies                  106,,,,,,,,,365
My mother smokes me out. We'll get these long periods of me thinking I'm too busy to call her up or e-mail her  and she'll send me something. My mom's a real whiner. I love her to death  but she always sends me these 'woe is me' things. I think she might be Jewish. I'm not sure. She's Baptist-Jewish  which is a double whammy.;Ronnie Dunn;mom                   110,,,,,,,,,365
The historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination  by itself  would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction. We also need intervention to promulgate a middle-class ethic of success among the poor  while expanding opportunities for economic betterment.;Henry Louis Gates;success                   111,,,,,,,,,365
The sad truth is that the civil rights movement cannot be reborn until we identify the causes of black suffering  some of them self-inflicted. Why can't black leaders organize rallies around responsible sexuality  birth within marriage  parents reading to their children and students staying in school and doing homework?;Henry Louis Gates;sad                   112,,,,,,,,,365
The guy keeps making speeches about redistribution and maybe we ought to do something to businesses that don't invest  their holding too much money. We haven't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists. Everybody's afraid of the government and there's no need soft peddling it  it's the truth. It is the truth.;Steve Wynn;government                    117,,,,,,,,,365
It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century  we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient  more transparent  and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.;Barack Obama;time                   128,,,,,,,,,365
And that's really what's happening in this country is a violation of the First Commandment. We have become a country entrenched in idolatry  and that idolatry is the dependency upon our government. We're supposed to depend upon God for our protection and our provision and for our daily bread  not for our government.;Sharron Angle;government                    139,,,,,,,,,365
Today's consumers are eager to become loyal fans of companies that respect purposeful capitalism. They are not opposed to companies making a profit indeed  they may even be investors in these companies - but at the core  they want more empathic  enlightened corporations that seek a balance between profit and purpose.;Simon Mainwaring;respect                   154,,,,,,,,,365
I got to get the right people in the right job. Because a lot of costs can be taken out in the context of your administration without the legislature.For example  using technology to do more with less. Using technology to fight fraud. Reorganizing and streamlining can be done within the context of the administration.;Meg Whitman;technology                     161,,,,,,,,,365
I did a lot of things that I regretted and I certainly paid for my mistakes. You have to go and ask for forgiveness and it wasn't until I really started doing good and doing right  by other people as well as myself  that I really started to feel that guilt go away. So I don't have a problem going to sleep at night.;Mark Wahlberg;forgiveness                    179,,,,,,,,,365
Today we often think that before we start living a religious life we have first to accept the creedal doctrines and that before one can have any comprehension of the loyalty and trust of faith  one must first force one's mind to accept a host of incomprehensible doctrines. But this is to put the cart before the horse.;Karen Armstrong;faith                     192,,,,,,,,,365
I didn't really hear any other music other than what my dad was working on until I was 12. My recollection of hearing other music was that I liked some things that I heard but I always thought  'Where's the rest of it?' It didn't have the same amount of detail or instrumentation or imagination in the arrangements.;Dweezil Zappa;imagination                     192,,,,,,,,,365

Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is  how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don't know what's happening to them?;Jason Reitman;design                     202,,,,,,,,,365
Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It's up to us  as a civilized society  to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;death                    231,,,,,,,,,365
I do not understand how it is that financial institutions could think that they could take taxpayer money and then turn around and act like it's business as usual. I don't understand how they can't see that the world has changed in a fundamental way  that it is not business as usual when you take taxpayer dollars.;Elizabeth Warren;business                     249,,,,,,,,,365
I think films about men are often about characters who don't want to express their feelings. You're supposed to kind of admire them for not expressing their feelings. And I feel that's a bit dull. Women's stories often have stronger emotional content  which I enjoy doing. What I really love doing is mixing that with humor.;Nigel Cole;humor                     250,,,,,,,,,365
I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet  lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy.;Andrew Weil;health                     267,,,,,,,,,365
We need to be discussing issues specifically to help the American people. And that would not include illegal aliens. These are people - I'm for immigration - legal immigration. I've been an immigration attorney. But people who have come to our country and violated laws  we should not be providing full health care services.;Joe Wilson;legal                     269,,,,,,,,,365
So we really need jobs now. We have to take jobs away from other countries because other countries are taking our jobs. There is practically not a country that does business with the United States that isn't making - let's call it a very big profit. I mean China is going to make $300 billion on us at least this year.;Donald Trump;business                      340,,,,,,,,,365
I don't think there has been enough communication between the players and the tournaments. In one sense it's just as much the players' fault. Players talk between each other and in the locker room about things that can be improved and then when the time comes to talk and really do something about it they stop.;Novak Djokovic;communication                      340,,,,,,,,,365
I don't want euro bonds that serve to mutualize the entire debt of the countries in the euro zone. That can only work in the longer-term. I want euro bonds to be used to finance targeted investments in future-oriented growth projects. It isn't the same thing. Let's call them 'project bonds' instead of euro bonds.;Francois Hollande;finance                      340,,,,,,,,,365
The reality of split government puts a premium on creativity within the administration. President Obama needs to put the right people in charge of the agencies and then have them push the bounds of administrative power to change policy through those agencies. President Obama has a pretty good track record of this.;Eliot Spitzer;government                      340,,,,,,,,,365
We need to understand that we are not each others' enemies in this country. And it is only the political class that derives its power by creating friction. It is only the media that derives its importance by creating friction... that uses every little thing to create this chasm between people. This is not who we are.;Benjamin Carson;power                      340,,,,,,,,,365
I mean  I get letters in the mail because I had a heart defect when I was one  I had surgeries and stuff.

I'm a big kid  I'm a kid at heart  so I still love the classic family films  such as the great Warner Bros film 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' - not the remake  but the original. It's still one of the best movies  hands down  ever made  and of course that goes back to the ingenuity of the characters and the storyline.;Corey Feldman;movies               13,,,,,,,,,366
If I'm with a man  is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself  if I'm with a man? Something that young women find out really quickly is that when you start dating  all of a sudden you're supposed to have a role. You're not allowed to just be yourself.;Candace Bushnell;dating                   17,,,,,,,,,366
It really depends  but  generally speaking  just because of the mechanics of it  voice-over is easier because there is no hair  no makeup  no wardrobe  no fittings  no line memorizing. You don't have to me woken up in Russia at 6 in the morning and go film a scene. It's just easier on the body  the family life to do voice-overs.;Kathy Najimy;morning             17,,,,,,,,,366
And when I was young  my family was perfectly nice. I write a lot about it  as you noticed. But it was rather limited. I think  I don't think anyone in my family would really feel I'd done them an injustice by saying that. We didn't see many people. There were many books. It was as if I wanted to get away from home.;Christopher Hitchens;family                   20,,,,,,,,,366
Four hours of makeup  and then an hour to take it off. It's tiring. I go in  I get picked up at two-thirty in the morning  I get there at three. I wait four hours  go through it  ready to work at seven  work all day long for twelve hours  and get it taken off for an hours  go home and go to sleep  and do the same thing again.;Peter Sarsgaard;morning             20,,,,,,,,,366
There is a universal  intelligent  life force that exists within everyone and everything. It resides within each one of use as a deep wisdom  an inner knowing.

When I get up and work out  I'm working out just as much for my girls as I am for me  because I want them to see a mother who loves them dearly  who invests in them  but who also invests in herself. It's just as much about letting them know as young women that it is okay to put yourself a little higher on your priority list.;Michelle Obama;work                  26,,,,,,,,,366
The perfection of our union  especially our commitment to equality of opportunity  has been a story of constant striving to live up to our Founding principles.

So long as I'm Commander-in-Chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. When you take off the uniform  we will serve you as well as you've served us - because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job  or a roof over their head  or the care that they need when they come home.;Barack Obama;home                  33,,,,,,,,,366
When you're going through something  whether it's a wonderful thing like having a child or a sad thing like losing somebody  you often feel like 'Oh my God  I'm so overwhelmed I'm dealing with this huge thing on my own.' In fact  poetry's a nice reminder that  no  everybody goes through it. These are universal experiences.;Caroline Kennedy;poetry                35,,,,,,,,,366
And under the existing circumstances  I understand there are situations where people indeed need care and need services  but I believe in America that the majority of those people are getting those services under situations and circumstances that are afforded to them by their health care providers and their state government.;Jan Brewer;health                    36,,,,,,,,,366
I wrote seven Myron Bolitar novels in a row  and I never want to write a Myron book where he just solves a crime. Every one of them I want to be personal  and I want him to grow and change.

No matter how many times people say it - 'Oh  I'm just writing this for myself' 'Oh  I'm just doing this for myself' - nobody's doing it for themselves! You're doing it for an audience.

I'm a firm believer that lighting affects mood  and twinkly lights on strings bring something magical to occasions ranging from concerts to weddings  though I'm fond of using them as year-round home decor. There's a reason why they're sometimes called fairy lights. When the night is right  there aren't any strings at all.;Erin Morgenstern;home                   46,,,,,,,,,366

I remember getting this scrapbook that this girl made  that I actually gave to my mom to hold onto because she has a 'Twilight' shrine in their house in Florida.

The business side of film has goofed up so many things  but even that's changing. It happened to the music industry and now it's happening to the film studios. It's crazy what's going on. But artists should have control of their work especially if  as I always say  you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea.;David Lynch;business                   54,,,,,,,,,366
In thinking about religion and society in the 21st century  we should broaden the conversation about faith from doctrinal debates to the larger question of how it might inspire us to strengthen the bonds of belonging that redeem us from our solitude  helping us to construct together a gracious and generous social order.;Jonathan Sacks;society                    58,,,,,,,,,366
Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves  they run about loose  hungering for employment  and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations  which have all to do with making things already made  is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;friendship                 63,,,,,,,,,366
When somebody who makes movies for a living - either as an actor  writer  producer or director - lives to be a certain age  you have to admire them. It is an act of courage to make a film - a courage for which you are not prepared in the rest of life. It is very hard and very destructive. But we do it because we love it.;John Carpenter;courage                   64,,,,,,,,,366

Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was  you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose  which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning  there was no rose.;Mitt Romney;morning                   76,,,,,,,,,366
I find that it isn't wise to attempt to judge people on their public persona  and even on the music they make. Because I've met so many people whose music I cannot stand  and they're very nice. At the same time  I've met people whose music I've loved  and they're not the person you've invested all this emotion in.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;music                  76,,,,,,,,,366
What people fear most about tragedy is its randomness - a taxi cab jumps the curb and hits a pedestrian  a gun misfires and kills a bystander. Better to have some rational cause and effect between incident and injury. And if cause and effect aren't possible  better that there at least be some reward for all the suffering.;Jeffrey Kluger;fear                    103,,,,,,,,,366
In the military I could exercise the power of being automatically respected because of the medals on my chest  not because I had done anything right at the moment to earn that respect. This is pretty nice. It's also a psychological trap that can stop one's growth and allow one to get away with just plain bad behavior.;Karl Marlantes;respect                     109,,,,,,,,,366
The Democrats co-opted the credit for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But if you go back and look at the history  a larger percentage of Republicans voted for that than did Democrats. But a Democrat president signed it  so they co-opted credit for having passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.;Herman Cain;history                    110,,,,,,,,,366
One of the jewels in the crown of Labour's time in office was the rescue of the National Health Service.

I think it's very clear that the American people are frustrated with this move toward socialism. And so whether you're back or white  if you believe that the conservative construct is in the best interest of our future  than you too would be voting with Republicans  and if you had the opportunity to run you'd join us as well.;Tim Scott;future                   132,,,,,,,,,366
But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders. Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman  you might not get into the conflicts in the first place.

I'm a morning person because I learned to write my novels while still practicing law. I would get to the office at 6:30 a.m. and write until other people arrived  around 9. Now I still do that. I start at 6:30 or 7  and I'll write until 11  then take an hour off  then work until about 2 p.m. By then my brain has had enough.;Steve Berry;morning                  161,,,,,,,,,366
All images generated by imaging technology are viewed in a walled-off location not visible to the public.

I've always been scared of advertising folk. I've met them at parties and I've been to their offices and I've always found them intimidatingly cool. At one company I visited  they held their meetings in a caravan that had somehow been installed in the place  a rather more exotic place to gather than the typical BBC glass box.;Evan Davis;cool                    173,,,,,,,,,366
The only people who live in a post-black world are four people who live in a little white house on Pennsylvania Avenue. The idea that America is post-racial or post-black because a man I admire  Barack Obama  is president of the United States  is a joke.

Our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality. This view of the world - biocentrism - revolves around the way a subjective experience  which we call consciousness  relates to a physical process. It is a vast mystery and one that I have pursued my entire life.;Robert Lanza;science                    196,,,,,,,,,366

I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents we're all teachers - if we're willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn  trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door.;Marla Gibbs;positive                     204,,,,,,,,,366
My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war  but to all other factors that threaten peace  such as discrimination  such as inequality  poverty.;Aung San Suu Kyi;peace                  222,,,,,,,,,366
I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type 'chokeholds' and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out.

Beatbullying's 'The Big March 2012' is such a brilliant campaign and I am very proud to be a part of it. I have been a victim of cyber bullying myself and I know firsthand just how hurtful it can be.

There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can't look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?;Andrea Jung;change                      341,,,,,,,,,366
The biggest novelty of 2013 will be new leadership in China. Very little is known about the views of the new leaders - who will rule the country for ten years. But we do know they're the first generation of Chinese leaders who have spent the majority of their lives in a China 'opening up' to the rest of the world.;David Miliband;leadership                      341,,,,,,,,,366
Well  marriage doesn't function in the way it used to in terms of deciding our fate  but it's in our heads  and it determines a lot of our actions. Like  right now  if you think about gay marriage - and they just started having the first gay marriages in New York - it shows what a potent idea marriage remains for people.;Jeffrey Eugenides;marriage                 4,,,,,,,,,367
To me  what I love about the draft is first  you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they've worked so hard for. That's a pretty cool thing. You saw the emotion from some of these guys the other day. And then  the second thing is this total sense of hope and optimism. And  I think that's great for everybody.;Roger Goodell;dreams                  5,,,,,,,,,367
I mean  we've built a lot of products that we think are good  and will help people share photos and share videos and write messages to each other. But it's really all about how people are spreading Facebook around the world in all these different countries. And that's what's so amazing about the scale that it's at today.;Mark Zuckerberg;amazing                    6,,,,,,,,,367
To this day  my mom's unsinkable spirit is an inspiration to me. For nearly thirty years  she's worked at the Library of Congress. Everyone knows Sameha simply as 'Sami.' Along with 500 miles of shelved books  her closest friendships are cataloged in that library. They are as much the value of work to my mom as is the work itself.;Hoda Kotb;mom                   11,,,,,,,,,367
I'm a visual thinker  really bad at algebra. There's others that are a pattern thinker. These are the music and math minds. They think in patterns instead of pictures. Then there's another type that's not a visual thinker at all  and they're the ones that memorize all of the sports statistics  all of the weather statistics.;Temple Grandin;music                   20,,,,,,,,,367
When I get up and work out  I'm working out just as much for my girls as I am for me  because I want them to see a mother who loves them dearly  who invests in them  but who also invests in herself. It's just as much about letting them know as young women that it is okay to put yourself a little higher on your priority list.;Michelle Obama;women                  26,,,,,,,,,367
The perfection of our union  especially our commitment to equality of opportunity  has been a story of constant striving to live up to our Founding principles. This is what Abraham Lincoln meant when he said  'In giving freedom to the slave  we assure freedom to the free - honorable alike in what we give  and what we preserve.';Paul Ryan;equality                 27,,,,,,,,,367
With respect to Barack Obama  let's face it Barack Obama is an iconic figure in the African-American community. We respect that. We understand that. African-Americans are going to vote for the first black president  especially when he happens to share the liberal politics on economic issues that many in that community hold.;Artur Davis;respect                    28,,,,,,,,,367
I had a fear of becoming anything  a fear of becoming a specialist. I might have become a doctor  but if you become a doctor  that's your specialty in life and you are defined by it. One of the attractions of being a writer is that you're never a specialist. Your field is entirely open your field is the entire human condition.;Graham Swift;fear                   33,,,,,,,,,367
Since the presidency of Ronald Reagan  conservatives have succeeded by adhering to a platform that rests firmly on three legs: smaller government  faith and family  and a strong national defense. These three legs do not merely represent a political coalition they are three necessary components of a strong and secure America.;Frank Gaffney;faith                   37,,,,,,,,,367
I love making people laugh and feel good  and that's awesome and special for me to be able to do that  but there really is nothing like kicking ass whether it's on a major scale  or whether it's in more of a dramatic fashion. Being physical and taking care of business the old-fashioned way is something that I love doing.;Dwayne Johnson;business                   40,,,,,,,,,367
People are roasting each other at parties  at work events  around the fire. It's so fun. People are busting each other's chops  and it's a sign of affection  truly. It's a true test of love and friendship: can you make a man laugh at himself? So what makes a good burn? Go after targets you love and respect. And hit 'em hard.;Jeff Ross;friendship                  41,,,,,,,,,367
It's healthy to have older friends. You go  'Look  I'm younger than them!' That's always the nice thing  if you can be the youngest one in the room at times. Like if you're always the oldest one in the room  you'll start to feel like the oldest person in the world. So get older friends  because they're cool. Get cool older friends.;Paul Feig;cool                 42,,,,,,,,,367
I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream  when I lock into someone or something  you can't get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. That's in friendship  that's a deal  that's a commitment. Don't give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand  that's for life.;Jerry Lewis;friendship                 44,,,,,,,,,367
If I am elected President of these United States  I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America  to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us.

I think I'm drawn to more villain-type characters  because it's so cool to get to say all the things you want to say. In Hollywood  you get to this position where you have to bite your tongue so much. You take all your experiences of not being able to say what you really want to say  and channel that through your character.;Gabrielle Union;cool                   49,,,,,,,,,367
In thinking about religion and society in the 21st century  we should broaden the conversation about faith from doctrinal debates to the larger question of how it might inspire us to strengthen the bonds of belonging that redeem us from our solitude  helping us to construct together a gracious and generous social order.;Jonathan Sacks;religion                    58,,,,,,,,,367
I don't know of a Democrat - whether they're a conservative  a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn't think that it's important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves  so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care  put money aside for pension  buy a home.;Tom Vilsack;home                  59,,,,,,,,,367
I think national issues play into gubernatorial races less than  obviously  in Senate and Congressional races. Much less. They tend to be more decided by personality  leadership qualities and by state or local issues. They still have some effect  no question about it  but not as much as Senate and Congressional races.;Edward G. Rendell;leadership                 63,,,,,,,,,367
I work on words quite separately to music. They're both ongoing  and I don't ever feel like I'm working in a cycle in that respect  because it's every day anyway  no matter what I'm doing. Then I get to a point when I've collected together enough words that seem like they want to be songs rather than poems  or sometimes not.;P. J. Harvey;respect                  63,,,,,,,,,367
If you asked an 18-year-old what they want to do with their life  and the options are 'Transformers' or Lars von Trier  he's probably shipping out for 'Transformers.' If you ask a 26-year-old what he wants to do  'Transformers' or Lars von Trier  he'd probably pick Lars von Trier. So  my sensibilities are changing as I change.;Shia LaBeouf;change                 64,,,,,,,,,367
The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge  place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It's been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It's a relationship that has evolved over time  given me the greatest respect and love for the game.;Michael Jordan;relationship                    68,,,,,,,,,367
As long as women are in the work force making their own money and decisions  men are going to have to realize that this way of life is here to stay - because it takes two incomes to make it and more now. The sooner you address your style of saving and spending with your mate the better off your relationship will be.;Patti Stanger;relationship                     75,,,,,,,,,367
Compassion is not a popular virtue. Very often when I talk to religious people  and mention how important it is that compassion is the key  that it's the sine-qua-non of religion  people look kind of balked  and stubborn sometimes  as much to say  what's the point of having religion if you can't disapprove of other people?;Karen Armstrong;religion                78,,,,,,,,,367
Tennis takes care of everything. It requires agility and quickness to get to the ball  core strength to get power into your shorts and stamina to last for an entire match. In addition to toning your arms and shoulders  it's a total body workout for your legs and abs  and works your heart and core unlike any other sport.;Samantha Stosur;strength                   85,,,,,,,,,367
I just recently joined Twitter. It's very positive - I love all the accolades. If my ego is hurting  I can just open my Twitter account and see 'Oh  I love you! I love the show!' and it's great. I'm trying to find the balance between trying to be funny  being honest and just being a promoter as the guy on 'Royal Pains.';Mark Feuerstein;positive                   99,,,,,,,,,367
Sectarian divide has created a schism in our society that is a major challenge. As monarch of all Bahrainis  it pains me to see many harmed by the actions of a few.

The sad truth is that the civil rights movement cannot be reborn until we identify the causes of black suffering  some of them self-inflicted.

I find interesting characters or lessons that resonate with people and sometimes I write about them in the sports pages  sometimes I write them in a column  sometimes in a novel  sometimes a play or sometimes in nonfiction.

It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century  we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient  more transparent  and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.;Barack Obama;change                   128,,,,,,,,,367
Greece's European neighbors were able step in and bolster the weak foundation on which Greece's free-spending budget was based. It would be difficult for any country  or intergovernmental organization  to rescue an economy the size of the U.S. if investors were ever to lose faith in our bonds because of our enormous debt.;Douglas Wilder;faith                    165,,,,,,,,,367
I'm terrible with my workout regime and following it strictly. I'm terrible with a healthy diet and following it strictly. I'm terrible on the weekends about getting up at reasonable hours and all of those things. But  when it comes to my work and the discipline it takes to get to work on time - I hate unprofessionalism.;Katherine Heigl;diet                     217,,,,,,,,,367
There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever. And I think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness.

Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It's up to us  as a civilized society  to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;society                    231,,,,,,,,,367
There's a tremendous difference between alone and lonely. You could be lonely in a group of people. I like being alone. I like eating by myself. I go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog. I have to exert myself and really say  oh God  I've got to see my friends 'cause I'm too content being by myself.;Drew Barrymore;god                    249,,,,,,,,,367
I've got some incredible fans actually - so loyal and they make me birthday cards and Christmas cards. I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs.

There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can't look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?;Andrea Jung;morning                      342,,,,,,,,,367
But my view is that you need a system at the border. You need some fencing but you need technology. You need boots on the ground. And then you need to have interior enforcement of our nation's immigration laws inside the country.

You don't argue with a four-year old about why he shouldn't eat candy for dinner. You don't punch a mentally handicapped guy even if he punches you first. And you don't argue when a women tells you she's only making 80 cents to your dollar. It's the path of least resistance. You save your energy for more important battles.;Scott Adams;women                      342,,,,,,,,,367
You know  if you look back in the 1930s  the money went to infrastructure. The bridges  the municipal buildings  the roads  those were all built with stimulus money spent on infrastructure.

The world is a crazy  beautiful  ugly complicated place  and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy.

When I climb into my car  I enter my destination into a GPS device  whose spatial memory supplants my own.

During my travels in Iraq  Israel  Gaza  Brazil  Indonesia  Japan  Europe and all over the United States  I have seen and heard the voices of people who want change.

When I was in Japan on tour in 2010  I felt like I was 30 years into the future. I love technology and they are so advanced with their phones  computers  everything.

In the rush to become all things to all people  the federal government has lost sight of its core responsibilities. As a result we're stuck in this frustrating paradox where Washington actually neglects things it's clearly supposed to be doing  while interfering in other areas where they are neither welcome nor authorized.;Rick Perry;government                    46,,,,,,,,,368
President Obama stands ready to work with everyone  because that's what the American people expect and deserve - not for the short term political advantages  but the long term health of our country.

I think that when we have a better educated society  when there is less violence in our cities  when people get back into the workforce and have the opportunity to take care of themselves and their families - that for me really is the kind of success and the kind of America that I think most of us still want  we aspire to.;Michael Nutter;society                   51,,,,,,,,,368

I love being on stage if I'm not on a set. If I'm at home  I'm usually in my office editing or reconstructing my website or whatever it may be.

Who knows what technology will emerge in the next five years  let alone 20. Yet the education we provide our children now is supposed to last for decades.

Like many other touchstones of twenty-first-century pop culture  'The Sopranos' was hatched in the late Nineties  predicting a future that never arrived.

The government's desire to expand global trade may be understandable  but we mustn't give away too much.

The best thing I ever learned from my dad was he knew he wasn't the best of singers  but he always knew he was a great entertainer  and I always thought that was a good concept to bring along  that ultimately acting is an entertainment art and you have to be aware of the fact that you want people to be excited to be watching you.;Dean Norris;dad                   83,,,,,,,,,368
What we're doing now is we're saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities  so that head teachers can decide what's truly important  because the big shift in approach on education that we're taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education                    104,,,,,,,,,368
If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff  there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that.

I definitely want to contribute to that.;Ellen DeGeneres;love                  123,,,,,,,,,368
It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn't own one of his paintings until 1946  when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met  principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.;Jerry Saltz;art                    129,,,,,,,,,368
That's why this generation is the least racist generation ever. You see it all the time. Go to any club. People are intermingling  hanging out  having fun  enjoying the same music.

Sometimes I make very selfish choices like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child.

Police in China can do whatever they want after 81 days in arbitrary detention you clearly realise that they don't have to obey their own laws.

The pattern of a newspaperman's life is like the plot of 'Black Beauty.'

Government has the role of suiting people for freedom. People aren't made for freedom spontaneously. There's sort of a 19-year race between when people are born and when they become adults.

China has not established the rule of law and if there is a power above the law there is no social justice. Everybody can be subjected to harm.

The point of mythology or myth is to point to the horizon and to point back to ourselves: This is who we are this is where we came from and this is where we're going.

When I was in college  I was in the theater department  which for anyone who has been involved in any kind of theater program  you know that it's really wacky and tight-knit  a real family. Me and my good friends from college would do random shows and plays that were sometimes serious  but most of the time really goofy and funny.;Darren Criss;funny                 21,,,,,,,,,369
Becoming emancipated at 14  my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school  so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company  Flower Films  and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30  I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography  and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art                26,,,,,,,,,369
I decided to give acting a serious  committed try  and soon after  I read the script for 'Lovely and Amazing.' The story was beautiful and honest  and the characters struggled with the same insecurities many women - including me - face. I didn't think I had a chance in hell of being in the film  but I knew I had to go for it.;Emily Mortimer;amazing                 34,,,,,,,,,369
When I was in Japan on tour in 2010  I felt like I was 30 years into the future. I love technology and they are so advanced with their phones  computers  everything. I think they had the iPhone way before we did in the U.S. I love gadgets  games  social media and I try to stay ahead on all that stuff  but they get it all first.;Soulja Boy;technology                35,,,,,,,,,369
The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front  again  are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious  as well as imminent  that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike.;John O. Brennan;intelligence                  54,,,,,,,,,369
Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it  and hardship and poverty aren't virtues. The good news is that  since almost no one will be selling art  artists - especially emerging ones - won't have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They'll be able to experiment as much as they want.;Jerry Saltz;art                   59,,,,,,,,,369
'Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992  an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling  money was scarce  and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings  performance art  John Cage  Joseph Beuys  and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile  a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art              59,,,,,,,,,369
I don't know of a Democrat - whether they're a conservative  a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn't think that it's important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves  so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care  put money aside for pension  buy a home.;Tom Vilsack;health                  59,,,,,,,,,369
We have lost that which has made us great over the generations  and that is the sense of individual and personal responsibility that we can come up  we can pursue our dreams and our aspirations and we won't be blocked by government regulation  by the inability to get a loan as a small business to make our dreams come true.;Jon Huntsman  Jr.;dreams                  62,,,,,,,,,369
Of course this is Vegas and it is the melting pot for all over the world  but people from all over the world know Donny and Marie. It is amazing. I have been in the business a long time to realize careers can be fleeting. Five years is a long career nowadays for some people  and here we are still going strong after 40 years.;Donny Osmond;amazing                    72,,,,,,,,,369
A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory  Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit  she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors' homes  in galleries  on the walls of auction houses  and off the walls  in museum storage.;Jerry Saltz;art                74,,,,,,,,,369
Throughout my 20s I spent a lot of time just playing and not really working  but fortunately for me I continued to get just enough work  and have a reason to wake up in the morning. I really empathize with some of my peers who had success in the early years then it dries up  and so there's no reason to get up in the morning.;Jason Bateman;morning                   75,,,,,,,,,369
Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency  ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for  or any work at all. So here's the question: Without a change in leadership  why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?;Paul Ryan;life                   83,,,,,,,,,369

I meant that the Chinese people are not aware of their own entrapment. They believe they live in a free society  but don't realize how much they are being monitored and controlled  how much the information they receive is restricted and warped  until they step out of line  that is  and feel the heavy hand of the state fall on them.;Ma Jian;society                 111,,,,,,,,,369
My mom sent me to regular high school because she wanted me to have that experience and not say that I missed out  but I didn't like it at all. I'm more comfortable in the world that I'm in  I grew up in it so when I get around normal kids in regular high school I don't know what to do. I feel more secure in an adult environment.;Alexa Vega;mom                    113,,,,,,,,,369
Feudal societies don't create great cinema we have great theatre. The egalitarian societies create great cinema. The Americans  the French. Because equality is sort of what the cinema deals with. It deals with stories which don't fall into 'Everybody in their place and who's who ' and all that. But the theatre's full of that.;Brian Cox;equality                    126,,,,,,,,,369
It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century  we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient  more transparent  and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.;Barack Obama;business                   128,,,,,,,,,369
Look at a football field. It looks like a big movie screen. This is theatre. Football combines the strategy of chess. It's part ballet. It's part battleground  part playground. We clarify  amplify and glorify the game with our footage  the narration and that music  and in the end create an inspirational piece of footage.;Steve Sabol;inspirational                  158,,,,,,,,,369
I am going to confront the old-fashioned negative thinking which says that all government needs to do to generate growth is cut worker and environmental protections  cut taxes on the rich and stroke 'fat cats' until they purr with pleasure. I'm completely repudiating the idea that government has to get out of the way.;Vince Cable;environmental                     164,,,,,,,,,369
I tend not to trust people who live in very tidy houses. I know that on the surface there is nothing wrong with a person being well-ordered and disciplined. Nothing  except that it leaves the impression of that person having lived in the confines of a stark institution which  although he or she has long since left  remains within.;Jack Dee;trust                   164,,,,,,,,,369
Being told about the effects of climate change is an appeal to our reason and to our desire to bring about change. But to see that Africans are the hardest hit by climate change  even though they generate almost no greenhouse gas  is a glaring injustice  which also triggers anger and outrage over those who seek to ignore it.;Sigmar Gabriel;anger                   177,,,,,,,,,369
Our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality. This view of the world - biocentrism - revolves around the way a subjective experience  which we call consciousness  relates to a physical process. It is a vast mystery and one that I have pursued my entire life.;Robert Lanza;experience                    196,,,,,,,,,369
My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war  but to all other factors that threaten peace  such as discrimination  such as inequality  poverty.;Aung San Suu Kyi;attitude                  222,,,,,,,,,369
I was taught by my father. He was head of the primary school so I went to his school until I was 11 - I was the youngest of four daughters and we had all been taught by him. But I didn't really enjoy my secondary education that much  probably because I am a very physical person and don't enjoy sitting at a desk all day.;Amanda Burton;education                     232,,,,,,,,,369
There's a tremendous difference between alone and lonely. You could be lonely in a group of people. I like being alone. I like eating by myself. I go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog. I have to exert myself and really say  oh God  I've got to see my friends 'cause I'm too content being by myself.;Drew Barrymore;alone                    249,,,,,,,,,369
Racial profiling punishes innocent individuals for the past actions of those who look and sound like them. It misdirects crucial resources and undercuts the trust needed between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off.

Sending Paris Hilton to jail for being the most loathed celeprosy lesion in the history of the species seems like a happening idea at first - forty-five days at Century Regional Detention Center is so the new thirty days at Promises Malibu!

China has not established the rule of law and if there is a power above the law there is no social justice. Everybody can be subjected to harm. I'm just a citizen: my life is equal in value to any other.

There is so much temptation to hold on to my career even more now. To try to micromanage and dictate every little aspect. But that's not how I want to do things anymore. I'm thinking about how can I trust God more. How can I surrender more? How can I bring him more glory? It's a fight.

I've got some incredible fans actually - so loyal and they make me birthday cards and Christmas cards. I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs. They've got this thing called 'Floetry' where they all have to put in artwork.

OK  so my parents were married in 1955 and my mom knew my dad was gay and my dad knew he was gay and so I was  like  'Why in the heck did you get married?' Like  what was going on? What was that time? It's like this crazy paradox that my whole life is based on  or my family's based on. So I spent a lot of time trying to understand '55.;Mike Mills;dad                 2,,,,,,,,,370
We  the People  recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me  a freedom without a commitment to others  a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism  is unworthy of our founding ideals  and those who died in their defense.;Barack Obama;love                2,,,,,,,,,370

Now  a lot of what we are doing right now  quite frankly  is because of what happened on Christmas. Many of the things were kind of in the works.

Charles Laughton  who's a great hero of mine  only ever made one film and it happens to be one of the great films ever  which is 'The Night of the Hunter.' It's full of his kind of imagination and creation and how you do things and just in the way he used the studio  I just thought it was a fantastical way of using the studio.;Brian Cox;imagination                  16,,,,,,,,,370
Especially for me  growing up in such a small town in the middle of nowhere  the desire to be away was incredible. I wanted to see new lands  meet new people from the city  and meet people that were in much less fortunate situations than I was  so that I could be more appreciative of my present. At least I had food on the table.;Garrett Hedlund;food                 17,,,,,,,,,370
I never felt totally 100%  patriotically English... I'd seen a lot of the world by an early age - sort of spent a lot of time traveling around Lebanon and I'd seen Babylon  and Damascus  and all sorts of places in the Middle East by the time I was ten. Then we'd return to Ruslip in West London... Done a fair bit of traveling really.;Andy Serkis;age                  20,,,,,,,,,370
The world is a crazy  beautiful  ugly complicated place  and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy. The caravan keeps moving on  and the job of the longform writer or filmmaker or radio broadcaster is to stop - is to pause - and when the caravan goes away  that's when this stuff comes.;David Remnick;movingon                 20,,,,,,,,,370
Propelled by freedom of faith  gender equality and economic justice for all  India will become a modern nation.

I think as a Canadian hockey player  you go through it in your mind so many times  being able to stand on that blue line and hear your national anthem play and being a gold medal champion  you dream of that.

If we want to address global warming  along with the other environmental problems associated with our continued rush to burn our precious fossil fuels as quickly as possible  we must learn to use our resources more wisely  kick our addiction  and quickly start turning to sources of energy that have fewer negative impacts.;David Suzuki;environmental                  36,,,,,,,,,370
I do a one-hour workout called Drenched  a cardio-boxing fitness routine  Monday through Friday.

That's what the Romney plan is all about  how to get jobs created  how to get this debt and deficit under control  how to revive small businesses so we can create jobs  and how to bring growth and opportunity to society instead of this class warfare  instead of speaking to people like they're stuck in some class or station in life.;Paul Ryan;society                 40,,,,,,,,,370
I think music is the greatest art form that exists  and I think people listen to music for different reasons  and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music  and some of it is things that might affect a person's day  if not their life  or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.;Eddie Vedder;art                 50,,,,,,,,,370
Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera  theater  music and dance are thriving all over the world  but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was  you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose  which he put on her bedside table.

If the euro zone doesn't come up with a comprehensive vision of its own future  you'll have a whole range of nationalist  xenophobic and extreme movements increasing across the European Union.

I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I'm growing as a person of faith  as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life.

It's one of the worst-kept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter  and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere: The favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it - the better to preserve the good thing they've got going and to keep their siblings off their back.;Jeffrey Kluger;family                     99,,,,,,,,,370
When we go to the Bible we should keep in mind that the basic principles of the Bible are taught by God  but written down by human beings deprived of modern day knowledge.

It was a good 15 or 20 years before anyone at Rand would be in the same room with me. They didn't want the question raised  'What's your relationship with Daniel Ellsberg?'

Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night.

One of the things I like best about 'Biggest Loser' is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health  like there's no hope  and you still make the choice to fight for it  to make the change happen no matter what people say or think  that's inspiring to me.;Alison Sweeney;hope                  173,,,,,,,,,370

Sometimes I make very selfish choices like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't  but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.;Ginnifer Goodwin;romantic                     187,,,,,,,,,370
All my friends were in college when I was making 'Superbad.' We were drinking beer and watching movies and eating pizza.

Strategic thinkers were naturally rattled to find this outsider fooling around with their work. They had been thinking strategically when Reagan was just another movie actor playing opposite a chimpanzee  for heaven's sake. They think Reagan is too naive  too innocent  to grasp the intellectual complexities of cold war strategy.;Russell Baker;war                   203,,,,,,,,,370
There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever. And I think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness.

I was very inspired by Les Blank's film 'Burden of Dreams.' I think what's unique about his film and the two I've made is that they're close examinations of filmmakers and how their own emotional experiences reflect in the material they're rendering  and vice versa - how that material sometimes colors their own lives.;George Hickenlooper;dreams                     249,,,,,,,,,370
It's not just Bin Laden or just those that are involved in the counterterrorism effort. We've gotta cast the net broader than that.

There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can't look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader.

Today  hundreds of millions dwell in freedom  from the Baltic to the Adriatic  from the Western Approaches to the Aegean.

And fifth  we will champion small businesses  America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business  not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most.

When resources are degraded  we start competing for them  whether it is at the local level in Kenya  where we had tribal clashes over land and water  or at the global level  where we are fighting over water  oil  and minerals.

I started out mopping floors  waiting tables  and tending bar at my dad's tavern. I put myself through school working odd jobs and night shifts. I poured my heart and soul into a small business.

Palin was a political Hail Mary  a long bomb in the closing minutes of a game that John McCain and Co. were certain to lose.

And so our goal on health care is  if we can get  instead of health care costs going up 6 percent a year  it's going up at the level of inflation  maybe just slightly above inflation  we've made huge progress. And by the way  that is the single most important thing we could do in terms of reducing our deficit. That's why we did it.;Barack Obama;health                33,,,,,,,,,371
If you feel your school is failing you  the question is why. Is it a lack of parental involvement  large classes  school violence  poor learning environment? Are there any standards to determine where problems are? Are there tutoring or mentoring programs? If the school is still failing after 3 years then what are your options?;John Rowland;learning                  38,,,,,,,,,371
Both my grandmothers had upright pianos  and I just knew how to play since I was a child. Nobody taught me. I sounded like a grown-up  and then I learned how to read music. I played so well by ear I could fool the teacher to believe I could play the notes. She'd make the mistake of playing the song once  and I could play it.;Valerie Simpson;teacher                   39,,,,,,,,,371
We have become a society that can't self-correct  that can't address its obvious problems  that can't pull out of its nosedive. And so to our list of disasters let us add this fourth entry: we have entered an age of folly that - for all our Facebooking and the twittling tweedle-dee-tweets of the twitterati - we can't wake up from.;Thomas Frank;age                    48,,,,,,,,,371
I think music is the greatest art form that exists  and I think people listen to music for different reasons  and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music  and some of it is things that might affect a person's day  if not their life  or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.;Eddie Vedder;best                 50,,,,,,,,,371
For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive  so leading edge  could be so useless.  And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things  while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things.  They are  in short  a perfect match.(Bill Bryson)                 56,,,,,,,,,371
Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it  and hardship and poverty aren't virtues. The good news is that  since almost no one will be selling art  artists - especially emerging ones - won't have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They'll be able to experiment as much as they want.;Jerry Saltz;money                   59,,,,,,,,,371
'Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992  an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling  money was scarce  and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings  performance art  John Cage  Joseph Beuys  and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile  a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;money              59,,,,,,,,,371
I have done many movies that people hadn't seen. 'The Fountain ' I spent a year on that. 'The Prestige' with Chris Nolan  and 'Australia.' From my perspective it's very satisfying. Some movies people see and other movies they don't. 'Wolverine ' 'X Men ' I know that in some level people know me just for that and it's fine for me.;Hugh Jackman;movies                  62,,,,,,,,,371
A company can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls  intrusion detection systems and encryption and other security technologies  but if an attacker can call one trusted person within the company  and that person complies  and if the attacker gets in  then all that money spent on technology is essentially wasted.;Kevin Mitnick;technology                 65,,,,,,,,,371
Usually I design the lighting and when I have the physical set there  I'm not good at going out loosely and saying  'Do you what you want  give it to the editor  and he'll figure it out.' I physically then walk on with the actors and I say  'Let's walk until you guys feel the space works for you  and tell me when all that happens.';Tarsem Singh;design                68,,,,,,,,,371
Since 'Idol' I've gotten used to having an amazing hair and make-up team around me  so I'm starting to get picky. I know what I like now and I'm happy to say 'Could we maybe change that?' if I don't like something. I don't yell or anything  but I think I could definitely start to act a little diva-ish when it comes to my look.;Jordin Sparks;change                    82,,,,,,,,,371
Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency  ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for  or any work at all. So here's the question: Without a change in leadership  why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?;Paul Ryan;change                   83,,,,,,,,,371
I had three points I wanted to make: That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left  that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office  and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who's not doing a good job. But I didn't make up my mind exactly what I was going to say until I said it.;Clint Eastwood;good                    83,,,,,,,,,371
It's a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime  and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That's why it's a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.;Betty White;pet                     84,,,,,,,,,371
I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me  and the other was the same age  and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends  and he of course was much older than me  but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.;Holly Madison;age                  93,,,,,,,,,371
I had a go at changing history - maybe not all by myself - I fought at the battle of Normandy  I slogged through the Ardennes  and I celebrated the liberation of Paris on the streets with beautiful French girls throwing flowers at me. I said good-bye to my first true love and discovered what I really wanted to do with my life.;LeRoy Neiman;history                    93,,,,,,,,,371
Both my parents are English and came out to Australia in 1967. I was born the following year. My parents  and immigrants like them  were known as '&pound10 poms.'

It's very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts  which was the way we did before 9/11  and then looking at 9/11 and saying  'This is not a criminal act ' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan  kill 3 000 Americans  blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That's an act of war.;Dick Cheney;war               110,,,,,,,,,371
I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school. Like all red-blooded teen American boys  I'd come home from water polo practice and eat a box of Entenmann's Pop'Ems donut holes in front of the TV while obsessively fawning over 'All My Children' and Erica  her clothes  and her narcissistic attitude.;Andy Cohen;teen                   121,,,,,,,,,371
It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century  we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient  more transparent  and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.;Barack Obama;government                   128,,,,,,,,,371
I was raised in New York City and raised in the New York City theater world. My father was a theater director and an acting teacher  and it was not uncommon for me to have long discussions about the method and what the various different processes were to finding a character and exploring character and realizing that character.;Vin Diesel;teacher                     131,,,,,,,,,371
There is no war on women. Women are doing well. But women are thoughtful. And what we in the Republican Party and across the country  Republican  Independents and Democrat women say is we're more thoughtful than a label. We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.;Nikki Haley;education                    132,,,,,,,,,371
I always found the extraordinary loss of life in the First World War very moving. I remember learning about it as a very young child  as an eight- or nine-year-old  asking my teachers what poppies were for. Every year the teachers would suddenly wear these red paper flowers in their lapels  and I would say 'What does that mean?';Tom Hiddleston;war                   132,,,,,,,,,371
I think there are so many ways to become interested in music. I believe signs of sustained interest gives a sense of the right time. Music  if thought of as a language  would perhaps indicate that as early as possible is not so bad. I do believe that a really nurturing first teacher that makes the child love something is crucial.;Yo-Yo Ma;teacher                    138,,,,,,,,,371
Religion is part of the human make-up. It's also part of our cultural and intellectual history. Religion was our first attempt at literature  the texts  our first attempt at cosmology  making sense of where we are in the universe  our first attempt at health care  believing in faith healing  our first attempt at philosophy.;Christopher Hitchens;faith                140,,,,,,,,,371
My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads  round and green  these places summoned and then held me up while I grew. Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land  and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;fear                   140,,,,,,,,,371
Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night. Up in front  there with the screen so big  a little kid all alone  and I loved it. I loved anything that moved up there and I didn't miss anything that happened and there was no popcorn either.;Marilyn Monroe;movies                   145,,,,,,,,,371
I first learned that there were black people living in some place called other than the United States in the western hemisphere when I was a very little boy  and my father told me that when he was a boy about my age  he wanted to be an Episcopal priest  because he so admired his priest  a black man from someplace called Haiti.;Henry Louis Gates;age                  156,,,,,,,,,371

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be  because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent.

The pattern of a newspaperman's life is like the plot of 'Black Beauty.' Sometimes he finds a kind master who gives him a dry stall and an occasional bran mash in the form of a Christmas bonus  sometimes he falls into the hands of a mean owner who drives him in spite of spavins and expects him to live on potato peelings.;A.

There are few things in politics more annoying than the Right's utter conviction that it owns the patent on the word 'freedom' that when its leaders stand up for the rights of banks to be unregulated or capital gains to be untaxed  that it is actually and obviously standing up for human liberty  the noblest cause of them all.;Thomas Frank;freedom                    230,,,,,,,,,371
No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well  you do the math.

Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about like the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had. I think that it puts you in your place because it really forces you to address the issues that you claim to believe in and if you can't stand up to those principles when you're raising a child  forget it.;Diane Keaton;experience                     311,,,,,,,,,371
It's not just Bin Laden or just those that are involved in the counterterrorism effort. We've gotta cast the net broader than that.

At this stage of my life I would rather try and have some small impact within a company and suffer through those things than make such a big stink that nobody can trust to work with you.

Well  first of all  we've got to get away from being offended by the truth. We've seen a 41 percent increase in food stamp recipients across the United States of America since President Obama was sworn in in January 2009.

Well  the album 'Intuition' is out and just went platinum officially. So I think to have the music doing what it's doing right now  man  it's the ultimate.

Music  as many people have said  is the universal language. Of course points are made which make you think about things  but ultimately it makes you feel. And that's why people remember more songs that have meant something during their life than films.

Since 1994  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have considered it politically risky to offer a plan to fix America's broken health care system.

My parents  and librarians along the way  taught me about the space between words about the margins  where so many juicy moments of life and spirit and friendship could be found.

In the past  I used to counter any such notions by asking myself: 'Would you really want President Hattersley?' I now find that possibility rather cheers me up.

My experience  with both my parents  is that grief has a lot of down  sad things  but I was also really emotionally raw  in the first year after each of them passed.

As a real person  he wouldn't last a minute  would he? But drama is about imperfection. And we've moved away from the aspirational hero. We got tired of it  it was dull.

Particularly black Americans  many of them  from quotes that I have seen and conversations I've had  are sort of insulted that the civil rights movement is being hijacked - the rhetoric of the civil rights movement is being hijacked for something like same sex marriage.

Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera  theater  music and dance are thriving all over the world  but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

I think people are confused about what the Tea Party is. I mean  they were a broad cross-section of Americans who came together concerned about our debt and our spending.

I'm interested in trying to explore what I think is the truth at a given time in my life  and part of the process of being honest is - in my mind - talking about the idea that you're watching a movie.

Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land  and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;faith                   140,,,,,,,,,372
Religion is part of the human make-up. It's also part of our cultural and intellectual history. Religion was our first attempt at literature  the texts  our first attempt at cosmology  making sense of where we are in the universe  our first attempt at health care  believing in faith healing  our first attempt at philosophy.;Christopher Hitchens;health                140,,,,,,,,,372
Drama can feel like therapy whereas comedy feels like there's been a pressure and a weight lifted off of you. You come to work and you laugh all day  you go home and you feel light and there's a certain feeling when you're sitting with the audience and they leave after 90 minutes and it's just pure escapism and they're happy.;Gabrielle Union;home                     148,,,,,,,,,372
I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn't like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car. He said to me  'If I give you $10 0  will you find me my wife because I want someone like you?' And within a year  he got married. That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.;Patti Stanger;car                  150,,,,,,,,,372
One of the things I like best about 'Biggest Loser' is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health  like there's no hope  and you still make the choice to fight for it  to make the change happen no matter what people say or think  that's inspiring to me.;Alison Sweeney;health                  173,,,,,,,,,372
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be  because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.;Steve Jobs;death                     192,,,,,,,,,372
We have seven pillars of development. India has a cutting edge information technology industry. We are setting up a technology park. We would like to see technology penetration iin education. Besides  we would like to see cooperation in industries like fashion  filmmaking  ship-building  education  health and energy.;Kamla Persad-Bissessar;technology                 199,,,,,,,,,372
I would have loved to do 'Alice in Wonderland.' Being a 'Bond' girl would always be fun. We had a lot of action in 'Eclipse' and I'd definitely like to continue down the action road. I want to do a romantic period piece  but those are really hard to get made because they're very expensive and there's not a huge demographic.;Ashley Greene;romantic                     219,,,,,,,,,372
Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to liberate them  I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world.;Lady Gaga;art                     230,,,,,,,,,372
There are few things in politics more annoying than the Right's utter conviction that it owns the patent on the word 'freedom' that when its leaders stand up for the rights of banks to be unregulated or capital gains to be untaxed  that it is actually and obviously standing up for human liberty  the noblest cause of them all.;Thomas Frank;politics                    230,,,,,,,,,372
I'm way better in person than I am on things like Twitter. I know Twitter is the best and fastest way to connect with fans who really appreciate you but I'm still not cool with it - although I am trying! I try my best but I'm a one-on-one person and I don't want to tell people I'm on the toilet or I just brushed my teeth.;Nicole Scherzinger;cool                      347,,,,,,,,,372
I can't do the same movies all my life. I'm conscious of that. But it's a trade-off. 'Dear John' allowed me to do movies I've wanted to do. You learn to balance it out. I'm still learning. Only now am I getting to do the kinds of movies that I have wanted to do. So it's a steady climb. You don't jump into a Soderbergh film.;Channing Tatum;movies                      347,,,,,,,,,372
God created the world the laws of nature were created by God. True science tries to find out what God put in the world. The trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they don't know what they're talking about because they weren't there. They can't speculate about the origins of life because they weren't there.;Pat Robertson;nature                      347,,,,,,,,,372
We  the People  recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me  a freedom without a commitment to others  a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism  is unworthy of our founding ideals  and those who died in their defense.;Barack Obama;freedom                2,,,,,,,,,373
But  yeah  I'm really happy when I'm writing. When I'm being creative and when I have something that I can put down. You know  if you go out and you overhear a conversation or you have a thought  you have a receptacle to go home and say  'Oh  this would be great in this script.' Your antenna's out in a different way  and I love that time.;Josh Radnor;home               3,,,,,,,,,373
Today  hundreds of millions dwell in freedom  from the Baltic to the Adriatic  from the Western Approaches to the Aegean. And while we must never take this for granted  the first purpose of the European Union - to secure peace - has been achieved and we should pay tribute to all those in the EU  alongside Nato  who made that happen.;David Cameron;freedom                5,,,,,,,,,373
I love women  but I feel like you can't trust some of them. Some of them are liars  you know? Like I was in the park and I met this girl  she was cute and she had a dog. And I went up to her  we started talking. She told me her dog's name. Then I said  'Does he bite?' She said  'No.' And I said  'Oh yeah? Then how does he eat?'

In most sports  your brain and your body will cooperate... But in rock climbing  it is the other way around. Your brain doesn't see the point in climbing upwards. Your brain will tell you to keep as low as possible  to cling to the wall and not get any higher. You have to have your brain persuading your body to do the right movements.;Jo Nesbo;sports                   14,,,,,,,,,373
This revolution  the information revoultion  is a revolution of free energy as well  but of another kind: free intellectual energy. It's very crude today  yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt bulb to run it and it can save you hours a day.

For my birthday this year  my girlfriends - who knew I'd just inherited my dad's turntable - gave me a carton of albums like 'Blue Kentucky Girl ' by Emmylou Harris  and 'Off the Wall ' by Michael Jackson. It's all stuff we grew up with. I mean  you can't have a music collection without Prince's 'Purple Rain' - it just can't be done!;Connie Britton;dad                 25,,,,,,,,,373
Becoming emancipated at 14  my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school  so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company  Flower Films  and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30  I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography  and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;history                26,,,,,,,,,373
I started out mopping floors  waiting tables  and tending bar at my dad's tavern. I put myself through school working odd jobs and night shifts. I poured my heart and soul into a small business. And when I saw how out-of-touch Washington had become with the core values of this great nation  I put my name forward and ran for office.;John Boehner;great                   28,,,,,,,,,373
Propelled by freedom of faith  gender equality and economic justice for all  India will become a modern nation. Minor blemishes cannot cloak the fact that India is becoming such a modern nation: no faith is in danger in our country  and the continuing commitment to gender equality is one of the great narratives of our times.;Pranab Mukherjee;equality                   29,,,,,,,,,373
I just moved into a new house  so I love spending time at home. Everything for me is all about self-care because I really feel that if I'm at my best  than I'm able to come to my job and really be feeling the best  so if I'm not working out or going on a hike  than I'm at home recharging and cooking dinner and hanging out with my cat.;Lea Michele;home                  29,,,,,,,,,373
Working with David Gordon Green  and Jonah Hill  and Michael Cera  and Drew Barrymore  and all of those people - those are the best people in comedy to work with. Anna Faris.

And yeah  we do all hang out  and we all kind of know each other.;Ari Graynor;learning              31,,,,,,,,,373
The aesthetic came along the way  I think - just through experimenting  and going on tour  and trying stuff out on stage  having fun with it  and not taking it too seriously. If I had a ballgown at home  I'd wear it onstage. If I found something in a charity shop  I'd wear it. That's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.;Florence Welch;home               32,,,,,,,,,373
Science fiction has its own history  its own legacy of what's been done  what's been superseded  what's so much part of the furniture it's practically part of the fabric now  what's become no more than a joke... and so on.

I was a huge theater geek growing up  and that was not the easiest thing in the world  especially growing up in Chicago  where sports are really the norm. I was always off to the theater at night  from 7 years old on.

I started getting these attacks in 2009  just as my music career was taking off. I'd be doing photo-shoots and started to feel like I was having heart attacks.

We all learn in school that the judicial  legislative and executive branches of government must check and balance each other. But other non state institutions must participate in this important system of checks and balances as well.

First and foremost I am a commercial writer  and I hope to entertain people.

The earth is rocky and full of roots it's clay  and it seems doomed and polluted  but you dig little holes for the ugly shriveled bulbs  throw in a handful of poppy seeds  and cover it all over  and you know you'll never see it again - it's death and clay and shrivel  and your hands are nicked from the rocks  your nails black with soil.;Anne Lamott;death               46,,,,,,,,,373
I think music is the greatest art form that exists  and I think people listen to music for different reasons  and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music  and some of it is things that might affect a person's day  if not their life  or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.;Eddie Vedder;change                 50,,,,,,,,,373
Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera  theater  music and dance are thriving all over the world  but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

When our governments want to sell us a course of action  they do it by making sure it's the only thing on the agenda  the only thing everyone's talking about.

I was one those kids who had books on them. Before weddings  Bar Mitzvahs  funerals and anything else where you're actually meant to not be reading  my family would frisk me and take the book away.

My dad tells me that he took us to a pantomime when I was very  very small - panto being a sort of English phenomenon. There's traditionally a part of the show where they'll invite kids up on the stage to interact with the show.

I like structure - like driving: go past the school on the street  stay on the right side  no hitting the car  go in right  you'll see a big church  stop and take a left  and you'll have it. By doing this I'm giving a structure of life  a path of light  and showing what happens between me and me  which is something very beautiful.;Jean Claude Van Damme;car             65,,,,,,,,,373
I had never walked on the street alone when I was growing up in Calcutta  up to age 20. I had never handled money.

I was constantly guarded.;Bharati Mukherjee;alone                 72,,,,,,,,,373
You bet every member of Congress who votes for this bill ought to read it  read it thoroughly  and understand that what we're looking at here amounts to nothing more than a government takeover of our health care economy  paid for with nearly a trillion dollars in new taxes on individuals and small businesses.

We Hoosiers hold to some quaint notions. Some might say we 'cling' to them  though not out of fear or ignorance. We believe in paying our bills.

The first trip I remember taking was on the train from Virginia up to New York City  watching the summertime countryside rolling past the window.

There are signs that the age of petroleum has passed its zenith. Adjusted for inflation  a barrel of crude oil now sells for three times its long-run average. The large western oil companies  which cartellised the industry for much of the 20th century  are now selling more oil than they find  and are thus in the throes of liquidation.;James Buchan;age                  87,,,,,,,,,373
Imagine the peace symbol. The peace symbol has three pieces in it. One piece is emotion  that's your body. Another piece has spirit in it  that's your fuel. Another piece has intellect in it and that's your steering wheel.

Sydney in the 1960s wasn't the exuberant multicultural metropolis it is today. Out in the city's western reaches  days passed in a sun-struck stupor.

It is in Rousseau's writing above all that history begins to turn from upper-class honour to middle-class humanitarianism. Pity  sympathy and compassion lie at the centre of his moral vision.

The history of the music industry is inevitably also the story of the development of technology.

The one thing I have learned as a CEO is that leadership at various levels is vastly different. When I was leading a function or a business  there were certain demands and requirements to be a leader.

Nothing drew me to the film business. I was propelled by the fear and anxiety of Vietnam. I had been drafted into the Marines. My brother was already serving in Vietnam.

Obama does not represent America. Nor does he represent anything what our forefathers stood for. This country is basically built on an attitude. It's a way of life. It's not because you're born here.

It's really important to say this. Often the faith schools were founded before the state provided education. I want good education in this country so I'm not going to slag off faith schools.

I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice.

The sight of allegedly sophisticated politicians parroting complete tripe trivialises and demeans government and it has to be stopped.

Bottom line is  I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I've been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25  my net worth was $100 million or so.

The coolest thing  and I have it at home  is a huge Hulk Hogan  normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours.

It was very clear to me in 1965  in Mississippi  that  as a lawyer  I could get people into schools  desegregate the schools  but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn't have food  didn't have jobs  didn't have health care  didn't have the means to exercise those civil rights  we were not going to have success.;Marian Wright Edelman;food            31,,,,,,,,,374
The secret to understanding me is  I'm not trying to be anybody other than who I actually am. People want candid  refreshing leadership. And I've always tried to go with solutions.

When I first thought of the idea for 'Sweet Valley High ' I loved the idea of high school as microcosm of the real world. And what I really liked was how it moved things on from 'Sleeping Beauty'-esque romance novels where the girl had to wait for the hero. This would be girl-driven  very different  I decided - and indeed it is.;Francine Pascal;beauty                   55,,,,,,,,,374
I wasn't in school often enough to really belong to a 'clique ' but my friends all studied hard and got pretty good grades. They were good people with self-respect. I still like to be friends with people I admire something about I really believe that we become like the people we're surrounded by  so I choose my friends carefully!;Danica McKellar;good                    61,,,,,,,,,374
I came back from university thinking I knew all about politics and racism  not knowing my dad had been one of the youngest-serving Labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in South Africa years ago because of the situation there. And he's never mentioned it - you just find out. That's a real man to me. A sleeping lion.;Johnny Vegas;dad                     73,,,,,,,,,374
End-of-the-world stories tend to ring true. I've always been drawn to them  but as I wrote my own  I found surprising pleasure in creating a world that is so radically changed  yet where there's so much meaning and value in every small and ordinary thing we have  and take for granted: hot showers  enough food  friends  routines.;Karen Thompson Walker;food               74,,,,,,,,,374
I thought Daredevil was kind of cool because he couldn't do anything. I mean  he's blind. It wasn't that he could fly. His major power was an impediment. So I was intrigued. When I took over he was kind of like Spider-Man-lite  but I was able to project a lot of my Catholic imagery onto it. And I'd always wanted to do a crime comic.;Frank Miller;cool                    76,,,,,,,,,374
It's a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime  and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That's why it's a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.;Betty White;family                     84,,,,,,,,,374
Cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things  like the old guys in 'The Muppets ' just throwing out comments all the time  whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people. I think it's noble and I think it's cool.;Josh Radnor;cool                   85,,,,,,,,,374
I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me  and the other was the same age  and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends  and he of course was much older than me  but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.;Holly Madison;dating                  93,,,,,,,,,374
It's extremely hard for athletes to accept what's happened to them sometimes. It's hard to be beaten by a small margin  and I've spoken with athletes who  for years afterward  have been tormented by the knowledge that  had they done something ever so slightly different  they could have been one-ten-thousandth of a second quicker.;Chris Cleave;knowledge                 118,,,,,,,,,374
What if the Soviet intervention was a blessing in disguise? It saved the myth that if the Soviets were not to intervene  there would have been some flowering authentic democratic socialism and so on. I'm a little bit more of a pessimist there. I think that the Soviets - it's a very sad lesson - by their intervention  saved the myth.;Slavoj Zizek;sad                    119,,,,,,,,,374
I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman  you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that  write about what you know. That's not what I do. I went as far away from home as possible in terms of the development of my imagination.;Anna Deavere Smith;home                    120,,,,,,,,,374
It is in Rousseau's writing above all that history begins to turn from upper-class honour to middle-class humanitarianism. Pity  sympathy and compassion lie at the centre of his moral vision. Values associated with the feminine begin to infiltrate social existence as a whole  rather than being confined to the domestic sphere.;Terry Eagleton;sympathy                    127,,,,,,,,,374
Religion is part of the human make-up. It's also part of our cultural and intellectual history. Religion was our first attempt at literature  the texts  our first attempt at cosmology  making sense of where we are in the universe  our first attempt at health care  believing in faith healing  our first attempt at philosophy.;Christopher Hitchens;religion                140,,,,,,,,,374
I actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when you're trying to make money  and then go to another meeting where you're giving it away. I mean is it gonna erode your ability  you know  to make money? Are you gonna somehow get confused about what you're trying to do?;Bill Gates;life                   144,,,,,,,,,374
There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery's version of the Barack Obama 'Hope' poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists. Depressing because Mr. Obama's Washington was not supposed to be the lobbyists' Washington  the place we learned to despise during the last administration.;Thomas Frank;hope                     267,,,,,,,,,374
What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don't write the book where it's a conspiracy reaching the prime minister I don't write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia  family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.;Harlan Coben;family                     268,,,,,,,,,374
So here is one of my theories on happiness: we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end. This view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of Philip Gould. Philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics. When he died  I felt like I had lost a limb.;Alastair Campbell;death                     294,,,,,,,,,374
'Dallas' hit a chord back in the late Seventies and Eighties because it was the age of greed: here you have this unapologetic character who is mean and nasty and ruthless and does it all with an evil grin. I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.;Larry Hagman;age                      349,,,,,,,,,374
I do support artists standing by their beliefs and walking with integrity. We have to find a better way to commercially exploit music while giving artists their proper respect. This cannot be done while taking their contributions for granted or trying to control the scope of their growth and power through threats and fear tactics.;Lauryn Hill;fear                      349,,,,,,,,,374
I can't do the same movies all my life. I'm conscious of that. But it's a trade-off. 'Dear John' allowed me to do movies I've wanted to do. You learn to balance it out. I'm still learning. Only now am I getting to do the kinds of movies that I have wanted to do. So it's a steady climb. You don't jump into a Soderbergh film.;Channing Tatum;learning                      349,,,,,,,,,374
I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.;Kristen Stewart;movies                      349,,,,,,,,,374
Truth is  I'll never know all there is to know about you just as you will never know all there is to know about me. Humans are by nature too complicated to be understood fully. So  we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or to approach them with an open mind  a dash of optimism and a great deal of candour.;Tom Hanks;great                   8,,,,,,,,,375
As a mom  I understand how important it is to ensure kids start their day right and always make sure my kids have a nutritious breakfast. One in five U.S. children live in homes where food is not always available  which is why I partnered with Kellogg's on their 'Share Your Breakfast' campaign  which provide breakfasts to kids in need.;Monica Potter;mom                   8,,,,,,,,,375

Obviously  there's the seedy side of the strip club world and pole dancing. But  pole dancing  as an art form  is really beautiful. It's been hyper-sexualized because it's associated with strippers  but if you think about it  just in terms of other kinds of dancing  they're using an instrument to create these amazing dance forms.;Megalyn Echikunwoke;amazing               9,,,,,,,,,375
If you say  'I'm going to cut this song because I know the teenagers are going to love it ' well  then you're going to alienate everybody else. When I cut my record  I'm just going to cut the things that I like  and whoever likes it  likes it. That's too much work to try to figure out the demographic. That's too much like a business.;Jason Aldean;business                10,,,,,,,,,375
And obviously  with hindsight now  now knowing what went on in the company  it would have been absolutely appropriate back then for us to have the chief executive of the company  most senior person in the United Kingdom  come and answer for the policy they were pursuing. And we ducked that  and frankly that's a failure of Parliament.;Tom A. Watson;failure                13,,,,,,,,,375
My personality  when tasked with creating meals  goes something like this: Is there a way we can make this more difficult? Because let's do that. I don't mean to complicate things.

Unfenced by law  the unmarried lover can quit a bad relationship at any time. But you - the legally married person who wants to escape doomed love - may soon discover that a significant portion of your marriage contract belongs to the State  and that it sometimes takes a very long while for the State to grant you your leave.;Elizabeth Gilbert;marriage                    15,,,,,,,,,375
I think there's a time to work  and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there's a time to relax  and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down. So it's a matter of planning  and being able to map out your year or your week or let's start with the day. It is just being multi-tasking and being available.;Vanessa Williams;mom                   30,,,,,,,,,375
As a kid who wasn't into sports  at school I felt almost alienated at times  whereas in the theatre community there was this amazing sense of camaraderie. Early on  we would go to rehearsals with my dad and I was like the mascot for the backstage crew. That was a big part of my childhood  so I dreamed of one day doing a play in London.;Zach Braff;sports                  31,,,,,,,,,375
Technology is such a broad kind of term  it really applies to so many things  from the electric light to running cars on oil. All of these different things can be called technology. I have kind of a love-hate relationship with it  as I expect most people do. With the computer  I spend so many hours sitting in front of a computer.;Jeff Bridges;technology                  39,,,,,,,,,375
That term's definitely got a negative aura to it  because people think a diva is somebody with an attitude who demands things all the time. Of course there is that type of diva  but my idea of a diva has always been a singer - whether male or female - who gets on that stage and captivates you with their presence and their voice.;Jordin Sparks;attitude                    48,,,,,,,,,375
We have become a society that can't self-correct  that can't address its obvious problems  that can't pull out of its nosedive.

I think music is the greatest art form that exists  and I think people listen to music for different reasons  and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music  and some of it is things that might affect a person's day  if not their life  or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.;Eddie Vedder;attitude                 50,,,,,,,,,375
Science has yet to isolate the Godiva Chocolate or Prada gene  but that doesn't mean your weakness for pricey swag isn't woven into your DNA.

Science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesn't exist yet  but soon will  and will change everything for everybody  and nothing will ever be the same again.

Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency  ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for  or any work at all.

And if the imam and the Muslim leadership in that community is so intent on building bridges  then they should voluntarily move the mosque away from ground zero and move it whether it's uptown or somewhere else  but move it away from that area  the same as the pope directed the Carmelite nuns to move a convent away from Auschwitz.;Peter King;leadership                   92,,,,,,,,,375
I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time  but it's not part of a sensible way of living. It's a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously. I treasure it in the sense that I believe it's a path of great courage. It can also be the path of the foolhardy and the compulsive.;Jane Campion;courage                     96,,,,,,,,,375
The state of New Jersey is really two places - terrible cities and wonderful suburbs.

I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school.

It makes sense that we came up with our public school system during the Industrial Revolution because it's like everybody is a factory worker  eating their terrible food and going back to the room where you're silent and listening to an idiot.

We face a choice this election.

I had come to the point when I realized it was unlikely that my film career was going to move beyond a certain level of role. And I was - because I had graphic instances of it - handicapped by the success of Star Trek.

It's not just Bin Laden or just those that are involved in the counterterrorism effort. We've gotta cast the net broader than that.

From my music training  I knew that  some Spanish rhythms apart  5/4 is a time signature used only in the modern era. Holst's Mars from the Planets is 5/4.

And I think it's a prudent  responsible way  given the scale of the emergency  the scale of the damage still facing America  that we finance these additional support for the unemployed as well as the support for small business.

It was very clear to me in 1965  in Mississippi  that  as a lawyer  I could get people into schools  desegregate the schools  but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn't have food  didn't have jobs  didn't have health care  didn't have the means to exercise those civil rights  we were not going to have success.;Marian Wright Edelman;health            31,,,,,,,,,376

With the never-ending stream of new social technologies  apps and platforms rolling out every day  its easy to get lost in the minutiae of social media.

I often talk with other actors about that time when you've just finished a job  because I think you do take on the characteristics of some of the characters you play. Sometimes it can be a great thing and sometimes it's a bit haunting because you're not quite sure how to leave it on set. My dad talks about it as being 'de-personalised.';Ben Barnes;dad                     78,,,,,,,,,376
The first trip I remember taking was on the train from Virginia up to New York City  watching the summertime countryside rolling past the window. They used white linen tablecloths in the dining car in those days  and real silver. I love trains to this day. Maybe that was the beginning of my fixation with leisurely modes of travel.;Billy Campbell;travel                    83,,,,,,,,,376
I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually  I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid  too  and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me  a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized  yeah  that's cool.;Nathan Fillion;cool                91,,,,,,,,,376
King's response to our crisis can be put in one word: revolution. A revolution in our priorities  a reevaluation of our values  a reinvigoration of our public life and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens.;Cornel West;power                    96,,,,,,,,,376
I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time  but it's not part of a sensible way of living. It's a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously. I treasure it in the sense that I believe it's a path of great courage. It can also be the path of the foolhardy and the compulsive.;Jane Campion;romantic                     96,,,,,,,,,376
When you see a struggle that you may be having personally put on a big screen and in a roomful of people  then it makes you feel less crazy or alone  because you're seeing that other people are dealing with it too. You get to see in this imaginary scenario how people might try and answer some questions or deal with some problems.;Michael Shannon;alone                    104,,,,,,,,,376
I believe there is complete equality between men and women. And I believe those passages in the New Testament  not by Jesus  but by Paul  that say women should not adorn themselves  they should always wear hats or color their hair in church - things like that - I think they are signs of the times and should not apply to modern-day life.;Jimmy Carter;men                  109,,,,,,,,,376
Music is a language and different people who come along are each using that language to do something different  but all coming at it in a similar vein inasmuch as it's always community based and for the most part nonprofit. Most bands don't ever come within a mile of profit - clearly these people are not playing music to make money.;Ian MacKaye;music                     110,,,,,,,,,376
Despite the fact that in America we incarcerate more juveniles for life terms than in any other country in the world  the truth is that the vast majority of youth offenders will one day be released. The question is simple and stark. Do we want to help them change or do we want to help them become even more violent and dangerous?;Ayelet Waldman;change                     116,,,,,,,,,376
What would be the nicest thing I could say about Newt Gingrich? He may be one of the great supporters of the humanities  because you have people who don't want to study the social sciences  because it's not profitable  and now Newt  as the highest-paid historian in American history  may be an encouragement to people to study history.;Barney Frank;history                 119,,,,,,,,,376
Everyone knows that exercise can improve your health. Exercise is a key part of managing your weight and maintaining healthy hearts  lungs  and other bodily systems. But did you know that exercise can make you more productive? The latest research shows that a regular exercise routine can make you happier  smarter  and more energetic.;Robert Pozen;health                  131,,,,,,,,,376
I always found the extraordinary loss of life in the First World War very moving. I remember learning about it as a very young child  as an eight- or nine-year-old  asking my teachers what poppies were for. Every year the teachers would suddenly wear these red paper flowers in their lapels  and I would say 'What does that mean?';Tom Hiddleston;learning                   132,,,,,,,,,376
In fact when you combine stem cell technology with the technology known as tissue engineering you can actually grow up entire organs  so as you suggest that sometime in the future you get in an auto accident and lose your kidney  we'd simply take a few skin cells and grow you up a new kidney. In fact this has already been done.;Robert Lanza;technology                    132,,,,,,,,,376
My dad has always been very proud of me but I think I have exceeded his expectations. When I told him I wanted to be an actor and moved to New York City  I think he assumed I would be playing the guitar on the subway and collecting spare change in my guitar case. The fact that I'm not doing that means that I'm a huge success.;Jesse Tyler Ferguson;dad                     152,,,,,,,,,376
My parents were kind of over protective people. Me and my sister had to play in the backyard all the time. They bought us bikes for Christmas but wouldn't let us ride in the street  we had to ride in the backyard. Another Christmas  my dad got me a basketball hoop and put it in the middle of the lawn! You can't dribble on grass.;Jimmy Fallon;christmas                    180,,,,,,,,,376
Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to liberate them  I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world.;Lady Gaga;teacher                     230,,,,,,,,,376
The attributes for entrepreneurs cut both ways. You need the ability to ignore inconvenient facts and see the world as it should be and not as it is. This inspires people to take huge leaps of faith. But this blindness to facts can be a liability  too. The characteristics that help entrepreneurs succeed can also lead to their failure.;Eric Ries;faith                     246,,,,,,,,,376
There certainly is no secret in that there are plenty of people who don't like plenty of my movies. Each one of my films is personal each one of my films is emotionally autobiographical. And I like directors who do that. With each one of my films  I'm exploring one of my own issues and I try to expose myself a little in the film.;Jason Reitman;movies                     246,,,,,,,,,376
Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother  according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.;Jonathan Sacks;family                     254,,,,,,,,,376
I've always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn't a singer I'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I'm quite visually greedy. I can't have things to be plain I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career.;Florence Welch;design                      351,,,,,,,,,376
See  the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it  the bitter honesty  is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary. Back then  there was so much post-Second World War fear that was imposed on everybody - 'You must live life this way' - and these guys were bored.;Garrett Hedlund;fear                  3,,,,,,,,,377
My parents  and librarians along the way  taught me about the space between words about the margins  where so many juicy moments of life and spirit and friendship could be found. In a library  you could find miracles and truth and you might find something that would make you laugh so hard that you get shushed  in the friendliest way.;Anne Lamott;friendship                 10,,,,,,,,,377
Looking ahead  future generations may learn their social skills from robots in the first place. The cute yellow Keepon robot from Carnegie Mellon University has shown the ability to facilitate social interactions with autistic children. Morphy at the University of Washington happily teaches gestures to children by demonstration.;Daniel H. Wilson;future                     13,,,,,,,,,377
Ray Bradbury is  for many reasons  the most influential writer in my life. Throughout our long friendship  Ray supplied not only his terrific stories but a grand model of what a writer could be  should be  and yet rarely is: brilliant and charming and accessible  willing to tolerate and to teach  happy to inspire but also to be inspired.;Greg Bear;friendship               15,,,,,,,,,377
When you're young  you're always wondering when you're actually going to feel like a grownup. And I think you probably fear it  in a sense  too. There's a danger to feeling like an adult... like this whimsical kid in you is going to die or something. And then all of a sudden  one day you kind of feel like an adult and it's really nice.;Drew Barrymore;fear                  17,,,,,,,,,377
Every now and then  I have blissful moments of thanking God for all the amazing things that are happening. When I leave the White House after just meeting Obama or when I see my face on the cover of 'Rolling Stone' or when I meet someone who tells me that their daughter is inspired by me  those are moments that are incredibly joyful.;Lea Michele;amazing                    18,,,,,,,,,377
Over the past 20 years  I have noticed that the most flexible  dynamic  inquisitive minds among my students have been industrial design majors. Industrial designers are bracingly free of ideology and cant. The industrial designer is trained to be a clear-eyed observer of the commercial world - which  like it or not  is modern reality.;Camille Paglia;design                 22,,,,,,,,,377
I call crony capitalism  where you take money from successful small businesses  spend it in Washington on favored industries  on favored individuals  picking winners and losers in the economy  that's not pro-growth economics. That's not entrepreneurial economics. That's not helping small businesses. That's cronyism  that's corporate welfare.;Paul Ryan;money                23,,,,,,,,,377
I'm just one woman away  my mother  from being the same as Mike Tyson. I would've ended up like him if my mama had not been so tough and strong. A lot of people  including Mike  don't know I came from the ghetto. They think I'm too nice and proper. But that's the way my mama raised me - to look people in the eye and respect them.;Evander Holyfield;respect                  23,,,,,,,,,377
To the citizens of Israel  I say: we have passed difficult years  faced the most painful experiences and overcame them. The future lies before us. We are required to take difficult and controversial steps  but we must not miss the opportunity to try to achieve what we have wished for  for so many years: security  tranquillity and peace.;Ariel Sharon;future                 25,,,,,,,,,377
When Whitney Houston died  I felt great sadness. My sadness  of course  was about our collective loss - when you listened to this nightingale sing  your body would drop into a chair  your head would tilt up  a small smile would creep across your face  and inside you knew that there was a higher power somewhere: gifted  beautiful  spiritual.;James Belushi;smile             25,,,,,,,,,377
I was a vegan for two years  and I really enjoyed it. Then  I got to a point in my life at which I wanted to do something else  so now I'm a vegetarian. You should make your diet one that best fits you and how you feel. Listen to your body. The most important thing is to exercise  drink lots of water  and take really good care of yourself.;Lea Michele;diet                 27,,,,,,,,,377
No one has done a study on this  as far as I can tell  but I think Facebook might be the first place where a large number of people have come out. We didn't create that - society was generally ready for that. I think this is just part of the general trend that we talked about  about society being more open  and I think that's good.;Mark Zuckerberg;society                  31,,,,,,,,,377
It was very clear to me in 1965  in Mississippi  that  as a lawyer  I could get people into schools  desegregate the schools  but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn't have food  didn't have jobs  didn't have health care  didn't have the means to exercise those civil rights  we were not going to have success.;Marian Wright Edelman;success            31,,,,,,,,,377
Europe is difficult to coordinate  and our main deficit may not even lie in this area of finance and economics  but in foreign and security policy. We have a leadership problem because we are still 27 different members who have still not decided on how to work with each other based on what we used to call a European constitution.;Peer Steinbruck;finance                    33,,,,,,,,,377
I was a 'Duck Hunt' and 'Mario' guy  and stuff like that. I was never technologically driven. I never had all the cool  new toys. I was the youngest child  I wasn't the only child  so I wasn't spoiled as a kid. And  we were on the farm  so we didn't have a lot. Also  with computers  I'm not very good with them. I just check my email.;Garrett Hedlund;computers              35,,,,,,,,,377
I got a poster from Columbia Records  and there's Miles Davis  Charlie Mingus  Ellington  Count Basie - everybody in that poster has died  I'm the only one left. And great players like Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan  it's hard to believe they're gone because we were all so close. But I believe in the future and the tradition will go on.;Dave Brubeck;future                36,,,,,,,,,377
I went to my dad when I was 17 and said  'I want to be a country music star.' Which every dad loves to hear. And he said  'I want you to go to college.' So we had a discussion. And I'm pretty stubborn. I'm a lot like him. And he said  'If you go to college and graduate  I'll pay your first six months of rent in Nashville.' So he bribed me.;Eric Church;dad                  39,,,,,,,,,377
My mom used to tell me stories at night  read books to me - and I read 'em over and over and over again. And you know what I learned from that? I went back and looked at everything - Why do I like reading the same stories over and over and over again? What  was I some kind of nincompoop? No - the narrative gave me connection with my mom.;Peter Guber;mom                    39,,,,,,,,,377
Technology is such a broad kind of term  it really applies to so many things  from the electric light to running cars on oil. All of these different things can be called technology. I have kind of a love-hate relationship with it  as I expect most people do. With the computer  I spend so many hours sitting in front of a computer.;Jeff Bridges;relationship                  39,,,,,,,,,377
I remember that at the beginning of the month  the kind of menus my mom and father would prepare for us would have fish  chicken. But at the end of the month - because my father would be waiting for paycheck - the refrigerator would get empty. I remember that without a lot of food left  some of the best meals happened right there.;Jose Andres Puerta;food                   45,,,,,,,,,377
The traditional spokespersons for the Evangelicals  such as Chuck Colson and James Dobson  have become alarmed about this drift away from the 'Family Values' issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of Evangelicals. They have expressed their displeasure in letters of protest circulated through the religious media.;Tony Campolo;family                    50,,,,,,,,,377
I have a great respect for incremental improvement  and I've done that sort of thing in my life  but I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don't know why. Because they're harder. They're much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed.;Steve Jobs;great                    50,,,,,,,,,377
Only the most unapologetic biblical fundamentalists  for instance  take every biblical injunction literally. If we all took all scripture at the same level of authority  then we would be more open to slavery  to the subjugation of women  to wider use of stoning. Jesus himself spoke out frequently against divorce in the strongest of terms.;Jon Meacham;women                 51,,,,,,,,,377
I had these kind of unrealistic expectations that were fueled by romantic comedies  and it has both helped me and hurt me in many ways. It helped me because  in general  they've made me hopeful. I just figure things will eventually work out for me. But nobody is like any Tom Hanks character. Nobody is Hugh Grant. No one is Meg Ryan!;Mindy Kaling;romantic                   82,,,,,,,,,377
I have my team. Like if you see everyone around me - I have my hair and makeup girl  my assistant. They're very calm  they're all about positive energy. There're no drama queens. Everyone wants everyone else to have a positive experience. There are no agendas. I think it creates a healthy environment and there are no boundaries to cross.;Fergie;positive                    83,,,,,,,,,377
The contrasts between what is spent today to educate a child in the poorest New York City neighborhoods  where teacher salaries are often even lower than the city averages  and spending levels in the wealthiest suburban areas are daunting challenges to any hope New Yorkers might retain that even semblances of fairness still prevail.;Jonathan Kozol;hope                    103,,,,,,,,,377
Here's the thing that I think about life - if you manage to get into a space where you don't need that much  where the overhead of your life is not that great and you're pretty happy and relaxed without that much stuff  you are really liberated because you never have to say yes to something because you want another refrigerator or car!;Brit Marling;car                    107,,,,,,,,,377
My goal is to get another 30 years out of this business. So I need to figure out the fuel to do that. And so far  I think it's respect and quality and company  not celebrity or box office or stardom. It's not a sprinter's approach. It's more like a long-distance thing. You can stick around a lot longer if you kind of slow-play it.;Jason Bateman;respect                    112,,,,,,,,,377
I'm quite good at taking in information so I voraciously inhale Wikipedia - which may have some things wrong in it  but I think is generally more information than we had before. Last tour we didn't have Wikipedia. And then Discovery Channel and History Channel. I can take it in and retain what I think are the most important facts.;Eddie Izzard;history                     114,,,,,,,,,377
Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don't seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste  momentary glitches in an artist's work  or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times  however  these problems mean there's something wrong with the art.;Jerry Saltz;art                  123,,,,,,,,,377
Another parent's different approach raises the possibility that you've made a mistake with your child. We simply can't tolerate that because we fear that any mistake  no matter how minor  could have devastating consequences. So we proclaim the superiority of our own choices. We've lost sight of the fact that people have preferences.;Ayelet Waldman;fear                    165,,,,,,,,,377
What is especially important is addressing the question of how religion can be enforced through political means and what can be done to create a political environment that  on the one hand  acknowledges the role of religion in society  while on the other hand does not impose one religion on the populace at the expense of all others.;Tony Campolo;society                   171,,,,,,,,,377
I think all Americans believe in human rights. And health is an often overlooked aspect of basic human rights. And it's one that's easily corrected. The reason I say that is that many of the diseases that we treat around the world  I knew when I was a child. My mother was a registered nurse. And they no longer exist in our country.;Jimmy Carter;health                     230,,,,,,,,,377
So here is one of my theories on happiness: we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end. This view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of Philip Gould. Philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics. When he died  I felt like I had lost a limb.;Alastair Campbell;politics                     294,,,,,,,,,377
You know what I have noticed? And this is really sad. Flying first class is less scary than flying coach. They speak to you and they're so nice to you and they want to help you and they know you want a drink before the plane takes off. And they bring it to you without asking. If you're sitting in coach and hoping for a drink  good luck.;Hope Davis;sad                     326,,,,,,,,,377
I feel like my music is just an extension of my acting. I treat the songs like scenes that tell a story... it's very similar. My favorite thing is when cartoon fans show up to my live gigs! They are always the most kick-butt audience members 'cause they're not trying to act all cool like a lot of the music fans do! It's refreshing!!;Grey DeLisle;cool                      352,,,,,,,,,377
Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice. It fails to recognise that climate change and our carbon reliance is part of problem - high fuel prices and food shortages due to poor crop yields compound today's financial difficulties.;Lucy Powell;food                      352,,,,,,,,,377
I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church's choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.;Katherine Jenkins;music                      352,,,,,,,,,377
I do support artists standing by their beliefs and walking with integrity. We have to find a better way to commercially exploit music while giving artists their proper respect. This cannot be done while taking their contributions for granted or trying to control the scope of their growth and power through threats and fear tactics.;Lauryn Hill;respect                      352,,,,,,,,,377
One thing that makes France different from other countries is the tradition of social solidarity. People from all backgrounds and political positions are willing to contribute for services and protection of society as a whole - but on the condition that money is being spent effectively and that everyone is paying their part.;Francois Hollande;society                      352,,,,,,,,,377
Now  do I think there has to be shared sacrifice among other nations in the world who want a stable and secure world? Absolutely  there has to be. But I don't think that America can ever abdicate its leadership role in the world because of who we are and where we've come from. We are the symbol for the world for freedom and liberty.;Chris Christie;freedom                    3,,,,,,,,,378
You know  it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things  it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles  telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective. I hope  someday  we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.;Diablo Cody;hope                 8,,,,,,,,,378
Decades ago  women suffered through horrifying back-alley abortions. Or  they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse. So when the Republican Party launched an all-out assault on women's health  pushing bills to limit access to vital services  we had to ask: Why is the GOP trying to send women back... to the back alley?;Lisa Edelstein;health                  11,,,,,,,,,378
For 50 years  nuclear power stations have produced three products which only a lunatic could want: bomb-explosive plutonium  lethal radioactive waste and electricity so dear it has to be heavily subsidised. They leave to future generations the task  and most of the cost  of making safe sites that have been polluted half-way to eternity.;James Buchan;future                  12,,,,,,,,,378
These past years  as we have been recovering and given our city a rebirth  we have been encouraged by our faith  knowledge  and steadfast belief that we will pull through.

I tell my students  it's not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself  somebody next door who looks like you. What's more difficult is to identify with someone you don't see  who's very far away  who's a different color  who eats a different kind of food. When you begin to do that then literature is really performing its wonders.;Chinua Achebe;food                 18,,,,,,,,,378
Over and over again  financial experts and wonkish talking heads endeavor to explain these mysterious  'toxic' financial instruments to us lay folk. Over and over  they ignobly fail  because we all know that no one understands credit default obligations and derivatives  except perhaps Mr. Buffett and the computers who created them.;Richard Dooling;computers                 19,,,,,,,,,378
Ladies and gentlemen  it is with great sadness that I announce that I will resign as Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am sad because I love this job.

A couple of months ago  I was down in Florida for the Food and Wine Festival. And this journalist grabbed me and said  'How does it feel to be a TV guy? You're no longer in the restaurant business.' And I laughed. I asked him  'How long do you think it takes me to do a season?' He said  'Well  200 days.' And I was like  '200 days? Try 20!';Tom Colicchio;food                22,,,,,,,,,378
For my birthday this year  my girlfriends - who knew I'd just inherited my dad's turntable - gave me a carton of albums like 'Blue Kentucky Girl ' by Emmylou Harris  and 'Off the Wall ' by Michael Jackson.

We cannot know the whole truth  which belongs to God alone  but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true. And if we offend gravely enough against what we know to be true  as by failing badly enough to deal affectionately and responsibly with our land and our neighbors  truth will retaliate with ugliness  poverty  and disease.;Wendell Berry;alone                30,,,,,,,,,378
I have hair that I audition with  my sitcom hair which is a curly wig. I have my long chic hair that I wear to my son's school so they know I'm not playing around. I always tell people that my husband gets a different woman every night when I come home from 'The View.'

It's part of a writer's profession  as it's part of a spy's profession  to prey on the community to which he's attached  to take away information - often in secret - and to translate that into intelligence for his masters  whether it's his readership or his spy masters. And I think that both professions are perhaps rather lonely.;John le Carre;intelligence                  34,,,,,,,,,378
The other day I got a text from a boy  but it wasn't hot. I mean  if you're going to text me every day  you haven't seen me for months and you're trying to seduce me  you'd better spice up that text and make it more exciting than 'How was your day? I hope you're having a beautiful one.' Sadly  I haven't been doing a lot of kissing lately.;Chloe Sevigny;hope                 37,,,,,,,,,378
For a culture that has such a problem with death  we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot  killed and blown up  and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But  the reality of it is that every day people die  and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.;Michael Sheen;sad                 48,,,,,,,,,378
Nolan has the strangest affect on people. You know  I think there's something very sad and little boy about him  but at the same time the way he goes about everything is so awkward and obnoxious. He can never say the right thing  you know? And I think if he just didn't try so hard and calmed down  people might actually like him a bit more!;Gabriel Mann;sad                  50,,,,,,,,,378
Being on 'Glee' was amazing. I remember my first day on set  my first day I arrived to the set I was in my trailer and all of the actors came and banged on my door - Lea Michele  Chris Colfer  Amber Riley  Naya Rivera. They all welcomed me with open arms  so it was a great experience. It felt like family  and I miss them a lot over there.;NeNe Leakes;amazing                59,,,,,,,,,378
Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that 'Oh  I don't get involved in politics ' as if that makes someone cleaner. No  that makes you derelict of duty in a republic. Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didn't insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable.;Bill Maher;time                   61,,,,,,,,,378
I would point out that I'm an actress for a reason! If I were popular in high school  I would have considered another career because I wouldn't have been alone in my room  making up other characters for myself. I definitely had growing pains. The popular kids didn't want anything to do with the girl who was starting the drama club.;Ginnifer Goodwin;alone                    84,,,,,,,,,378
Here is my prescription to heal all wounds. Watch the film 'Funny Girl' at least five times  eat at least 45 chocolate bars  and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex. I truly believe that  through a combination of Nutella  old pals and Barbra Streisand  we can achieve happiness and  very probably  world peace.;Beth Ditto;funny               91,,,,,,,,,378

I want to improve TSA's counterterrorism focus through intelligence and cutting edge technology  support the TSA workforce  and strengthen the agency's relationships with stakeholders and the traveling public. All of these priorities are interconnected and are vital to TSA's mission - and I would say  all of our collective mission.;John Pistole;technology                   95,,,,,,,,,378
I think Islam has been hijacked by the idea that all Muslims are terrorists that Islam is about hate  about war  about jihad - I think that hijacks the spirituality and beauty that exists within Islam. I believe in allowing Islam to be seen in context and in its entirety and being judged on what it really is  not what you think it is.;Aasif Mandvi;beauty                   100,,,,,,,,,378
A lesser complaint: hair extensions. There are moments on 'All My Children' when half the women actors  young and old  seem to be afflicted by android Barbie creep. All those thick swatches of lifeless strands clustering lankly round ladies' necks! Like orange tanning spray  this is a fashion fad that should be put out of its misery.;Camille Paglia;women                   102,,,,,,,,,378
I believe there is complete equality between men and women. And I believe those passages in the New Testament  not by Jesus  but by Paul  that say women should not adorn themselves  they should always wear hats or color their hair in church - things like that - I think they are signs of the times and should not apply to modern-day life.;Jimmy Carter;women                  109,,,,,,,,,378
Patriotism is best exemplified through auto-critique. When you're willing to stand up within the group and say  'It is wrong for Black people to be anti-Semitic ' or 'It is wrong for America to discriminate against persons of African descent and made them slaves and based its wealth upon free labor ' it's crucial to say that.;Henry Louis Gates;patriotism                   110,,,,,,,,,378
There's really no such thing as the agony of dying. I'm quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death. You see  something happens when the body knows it's about to go. Peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Endorphins. They attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain.;Lewis Thomas;death                     120,,,,,,,,,378
The legal principle placing the burden of proof on accusers rather than the accused can be traced back to Second and Third Century Roman jurist  Julius Paulus Prudentissimus. Yet  this ancient concept  which forms the legal and moral cornerstone of the American judicial system  is quickly being undermined in the name of 'national security.';Bob Barr;legal                  143,,,,,,,,,378
I'm very proud of my love for Whitney Houston. She really changed my life. She made my life a better life. She was so beautiful in her love for God  her love for her family and her love for music. She truly loved her music. She could do everything! She had flawless rhythm  flawless pitch  flawless feeling  and flawless beauty.;Narada Michael Walden;beauty                  147,,,,,,,,,378
We face a choice this election. President Obama is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeed - jobs  education  health reform  the DREAM Act  equal pay for women. He is moving us forward with opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow. Mitt Romney wants to take us back to yesterday.;Eva Longoria;education                  151,,,,,,,,,378
I'm the most inappropriate dad. I curse in front of my kids and their friends. I let my kids watch R-rated movies. I'll walk by the movie theater and say  'Let's go see that ' and my kids will say  'No  it's rated R. It's not appropriate for kids.' I'm like Uncle Dad. We have fun. I don't live with them  but I drive over four days a week.;Marlon Wayans;dad                 153,,,,,,,,,378
I'm a vegetarian and very much active in regards to how I feel about animal rights and protecting animals and giving animals a voice. But at the same time  I appreciate and respect other people's decisions to eat meat. The only thing that I hope is that people are educated  that they're aware  that they're living a conscious lifestyle.;Abbie Cornish;hope                   154,,,,,,,,,378
What is especially important is addressing the question of how religion can be enforced through political means and what can be done to create a political environment that  on the one hand  acknowledges the role of religion in society  while on the other hand does not impose one religion on the populace at the expense of all others.;Tony Campolo;religion                   171,,,,,,,,,378
I want people to think about movies and how we watch them. Let them know it's okay to question the structure or how we're sometimes duped into a false sense of normalcy. Most of all  I want people to question the old standard practices of  'This is how the structure of something should work ' or  'This is how a character must behave.';Tim Heidecker;movies                  181,,,,,,,,,378
Let me just say that to imagine racism does not exist is imagination. And to imagine that it does not create its own set of problems is true imagination. So let's not imagine that racism is gone  extinguished  because it's not. We are seeing this in the top levels of the political arena  and we are seeing it very  very plainly.;Phylicia Rashad;imagination                  194,,,,,,,,,378
What were once only hopes for the future have now come to pass it is almost exactly 13 years since the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland voted in favour of the agreement signed on Good Friday 1998  paving the way for Northern Ireland to become the exciting and inspirational place that it is today.;Queen Elizabeth II;future                     226,,,,,,,,,378
The attributes for entrepreneurs cut both ways. You need the ability to ignore inconvenient facts and see the world as it should be and not as it is. This inspires people to take huge leaps of faith. But this blindness to facts can be a liability  too. The characteristics that help entrepreneurs succeed can also lead to their failure.;Eric Ries;failure                     246,,,,,,,,,378
So here is one of my theories on happiness: we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end. This view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of Philip Gould. Philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics. When he died  I felt like I had lost a limb.;Alastair Campbell;happiness                     294,,,,,,,,,378
In the past week it has become clear that the vote on the final healthcare bill will be very close. I take this vote with the utmost seriousness. I am quite aware of the historic fight that has lasted the better part of the last century to bring America in line with other modern democracies in providing single payer health care.;Dennis Kucinich;health                      353,,,,,,,,,378
Now  I'm a failed political consultant. But sometimes fiction has a way of capturing people's imagination in a way that non-fiction doesn't. Conservatives typically haven't written much fiction - specifically political thrillers - over the years to educate  inspire and mobilize people on issues of great import  but we ought to.;Joel C. Rosenberg;imagination                   3,,,,,,,,,379
Well  right now  I'm very fascinated with 1920s Berlin. I mean  probably the more interesting thing would be to go to the beginning of civilization or precivilization - like polytheistic times. It would be interesting to see what came before modern religion and culture - what circumstances created the environment or the need for it.;Natalie Portman;religion                   4,,,,,,,,,379
First  I want to pay tribute to Diana myself. She was an exceptional and gifted human being. In good times and bad  she never lost her capacity to smile and laugh  nor to inspire others with her warmth and kindness. I admired and respected her - for her energy and commitment to others  and especially for her devotion to her two boys.;Queen Elizabeth II;smile                  5,,,,,,,,,379
Growing up  my sisters and I would always talk stories. One of my frustrations was I didn't know anything about cameras. I didn't know how to make a film and I obviously didn't have a special effects budget. I was a kid. So I was learning to draw to get down the stuff that was in my head  that I couldn't afford to actually do.;Jennifer Yuh Nelson;learning                    10,,,,,,,,,379
My experience  with both my parents  is that grief has a lot of down  sad things  but I was also really emotionally raw  in the first year after each of them passed. Flowers smelled more intensely  my relationships were hotter  and I was more willing to risk. I was going for it a lot more. I was 'unsober' and I wasn't playing by my rules.;Mike Mills;experience               13,,,,,,,,,379
Unfenced by law  the unmarried lover can quit a bad relationship at any time. But you - the legally married person who wants to escape doomed love - may soon discover that a significant portion of your marriage contract belongs to the State  and that it sometimes takes a very long while for the State to grant you your leave.;Elizabeth Gilbert;relationship                    15,,,,,,,,,379
I love the movies  and when I go to see a movie that's been made from one of my books  I know that it isn't going to be exactly like my novel because a lot of other people have interpreted it. But I also know it has an idea that I'll like because that idea occurred to me  and I spent a year  or a year and a half of my life working on it.;Stephen King;movies                  17,,,,,,,,,379
The more you travel  the better you get at it. It sounds silly  but with experience you learn how to pack the right way. I remember one of my first trips abroad  travelling around Europe by rail  fresh out of high school. I brought all these books with me and a paint set. I really had too much stuff  so I've learnt to be more economical.;Roman Coppola;travel                 19,,,,,,,,,379
I have written some songs  but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day  because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for  like  a week and then I won't touch it for a month. I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time  because I'd rather be doing other things  like knitting.;Amanda Seyfried;poetry                25,,,,,,,,,379
And it was back in the mid-1980s  and as I point out in a piece  that was when we are spending about eight percent of our gross domestic product on health care. And even then  we had the impression that so much of the excessive  aggressive medical treatment that took place at the end of life was not only unnecessary but it was cruel.;Richard Dooling;medical                  32,,,,,,,,,379
I learned a good deal about economics  and about America  from the author of the Reagan tax reforms - the great Jack Kemp. What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people  in the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.;Paul Ryan;power                   37,,,,,,,,,379
I like things that are kind of eclectic  when one thing doesn't go with another. That's why I love Rome. The town itself is that way. It's where Fascist architecture meets classic Renaissance  where the ancient bangs up against the contemporary. It has a touch of everything. That's my style  and that's what my work is about.;Giambattista Valli;architecture                   39,,,,,,,,,379
Everyone prefers some foods over others  but some adults take this tendency to an extreme. These people tend to prefer the kinds of bland food they may have enjoyed as children - such as plain or buttered pasta  macaroni and cheese  cheese pizza  French fries and grilled cheese sandwiches - and to restrict their eating to just a few dishes.;Andrew Weil;food                  39,,,,,,,,,379
My dad and mom divorced when I was around ten  and I didn't live with him after that  though he was close by and we saw each other weekly. I wasn't really aware that he was a writer I didn't start reading his writing until I was about fifteen. It occurred to me then that my dad was kind of special he's still one of my favorite writers.;Andre Dubus III;dad                    45,,,,,,,,,379
We certainly want those at the top to do well  but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better  you're missing what makes the economy tick.

I have a great respect for incremental improvement  and I've done that sort of thing in my life  but I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don't know why. Because they're harder. They're much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed.;Steve Jobs;respect                    50,,,,,,,,,379
Indians mock their corrupt politicians relentlessly  but they regard their honest politicians with silent suspicion. The first thing they do when they hear of a supposedly 'clean' politician is to grin. It is a cliche that honest politicians in India tend to have dishonest sons  who collect money from people seeking an audience with Dad.;Aravind Adiga;dad                    51,,,,,,,,,379
I'm very happy with the way I look. I wake up some morning  catch myself in the bathroom mirror  and go  'hey girl  you're alright'. But on the other hand  I find the website stuff  and the polls  something completely removed from my own personal life. You can't take anything like that too seriously  otherwise you'd end up in the loony bin.;Cameron Diaz;morning              58,,,,,,,,,379
I came back from university thinking I knew all about politics and racism  not knowing my dad had been one of the youngest-serving Labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in South Africa years ago because of the situation there.

What is news? It's hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely  and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news  except to tell you what happened overnight  and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this  a little bit of that. It's harder to be an educated and informed citizen.;Harrison Ford;morning                  74,,,,,,,,,379
My parents were working class folks. My dad was a bartender for most of his life  my mom was a maid and a cashier and a stock clerk at WalMart.

I'm getting a lot of stick because my character in 'Young Dracula' wanted to be vampire  so now that I am a vampire  everyone's like  'You finally did it!' But it's cool and I loved doing 'Young Dracula.'

Everything that everyone is afraid of has already happened: The fragility of capitalism  which we don't want to admit the loss of the empire of the United States and American exceptionalism. In fact  American exceptionalism is that we are exceptionally backward in about fifteen different categories  from education to infrastructure.;James Hillman;education                   87,,,,,,,,,379
I also like to look at the dynamic that takes place between religion and science because  in a way  both are asking the same questions: Who are we? Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? The methodologies are diametrically opposed  but their motivation is the same the wellspring is the same in both cases.;J.

I've been saying for a couple of years now that people need to let God out of the Sunday morning box  that He doesn't want to just be with you for an hour or two on Sunday morning and then put back in His box to sit there until you have an emergency  but He wants to invade your Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  and Sunday.;Joyce Meyer;god              100,,,,,,,,,379
I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker  put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start  but where you're going. That's family values.;Al Sharpton;mom                    100,,,,,,,,,379
Today we have a health insurance industry where the first and foremost goal is to maximize profits for shareholders and CEOs  not to cover patients who have fallen ill or to compensate doctors and hospitals for their services.

Widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country. For more than 60 years  anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed. Chinese art is merely a product: it avoids any meaningful engagement. There is no larger context.

I've never had a very closely connected family. My parents split up when I was young and I was living with my mom for a little while  then I was kind of just on my own really young. It wasn't some kind of global tragedy  it was just never really a very close-knit family. So there was support in the sense that they didn't stand in my way.;Ani DiFranco;mom                    132,,,,,,,,,379

I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson  FDR  and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history.

It's really cool to know that you've put something together that isn't for a particular audience. It's so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population  and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.;David Krumholtz;cool                     178,,,,,,,,,379

I like something where I can really use my imagination and be an active participant in the construction of the monster and usually that's in the world of the supernatural or the world of the fantastic  so that's why those kinds of stories about demons and the supernatural appeal to me or maybe I'm really interested in that subject.;Sam Raimi;imagination                     200,,,,,,,,,379
'Aladdin' was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. 'Aladdin' was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys  which I loved. It wasn't a princess or a girl beating the odds it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.;Zachary Levi;cool                     221,,,,,,,,,379
One of the problems we've had is that the ICT curriculum in the past has been written for a subject that is changing all the time. I think that what we should have is computer science in the future - and how it fits in to the curriculum is something we need to be talking to scientists  to experts in coding and to young people about.;Michael Gove;science                     285,,,,,,,,,379
The message that I gave on the - on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual. Believe in the power of one person. Don't believe that you can't do it. Everybody wants - everybody wants a shot. That we can all agree on. Beyond that  it becomes politics. I'm not talking politics.;Glenn Beck;power                     290,,,,,,,,,379
The trick of this thing and the beauty of this thing is that it's a cowboy movie first and then stuff happens. Even after stuff happens it doesn't change - it hasn't suddenly changed into another kind of movie. It's still a cowboy movie. And that's what's incredible about it because nobody has done that before  that's new territory.;Harrison Ford;beauty                     311,,,,,,,,,379
Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice.

Also  because people like to multitask  in a way if you've got a bit of music on in the background and the lyrical content is making you want to listen to it  then that would probably put you off the texting you wanted to do.

If you're married  and you have a wife  and you really love your wife  is it good enough to only say to your wife 'I love her' the day you get married?

If you're married  and you have a wife  and you really love your wife  is it good enough to only say to your wife 'I love her' the day you get married? Or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity? And that's how I feel about my relationship with Jesus Christ is that it is the most important thing in my life.;Tim Tebow;love                   17,,,,,,,,,380
I do love science fiction  but it's not really a genre unto itself it always seems to merge with another genre. With the few movies I've done  I've ended up playing with genre in some way or another  so any genre that's made to mix with others is like candy to me. It allows you to use big  mythic situations to talk about ordinary things.;Rian Johnson;science                  25,,,,,,,,,380
I am kind of a private person  so I don't miss that part of show business at all. Looking back on my career in television and making a movie like 'The Sound of Music' from an adult point of view  it actually seems kind of unreal. I was involved in shows that people grew up with - that hold memories for them - and it's a cool feeling.;Angela Cartwright;cool                    29,,,,,,,,,380
When you look at Michael Jackson  there's nobody who loves him in that family  nobody. If they did  they'd tell him he didn't have to do all that in order to be famous. All he has to do is keep doing his music and be himself. Michael's been a little touched for about 20 years  but somebody needs to pull him aside and tell him they love him.;Jamie Foxx;famous                  32,,,,,,,,,380
Europe is difficult to coordinate  and our main deficit may not even lie in this area of finance and economics  but in foreign and security policy. We have a leadership problem because we are still 27 different members who have still not decided on how to work with each other based on what we used to call a European constitution.;Peer Steinbruck;leadership                    33,,,,,,,,,380
The Oval Office symbolizes... the Constitution  the hopes and dreams  and I'm going to say democracy. And when you have a dress code in the Supreme Court and a dress code on the floor of the Senate  floor of the House  I think it's appropriate to have an expectation that there will be a dress code that respects the office of the President.;Andrew Card;dreams                  46,,,,,,,,,380
For a culture that has such a problem with death  we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot  killed and blown up  and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But  the reality of it is that every day people die  and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.;Michael Sheen;death                 48,,,,,,,,,380

Disappointment is inevitable. But to become discouraged  there's a choice I make. God would never discourage me. He would always point me to himself to trust him.

The poster boy for our superabled future is Oscar Pistorius  an increasingly famous South African sprinter who happens to have had both of his legs amputated below the knee.

I was from such a large family that when I first met my wife  I told her: 'You can go work outside of the house and I'll stay home and continue making my cartoon strips.

Technology has a shadow side. It accounts for real progress in medicine  but has also hurt it in many ways  making it more impersonal  expensive and dangerous. The false belief that a safety net of sophisticated drugs and machines stretches below us  permitting risky or lazy lifestyle choices  has undermined our spirit of self-reliance.;Andrew Weil;technology                 71,,,,,,,,,380
I also like to look at the dynamic that takes place between religion and science because  in a way  both are asking the same questions: Who are we? Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? The methodologies are diametrically opposed  but their motivation is the same the wellspring is the same in both cases.;J.

When I was in fourth grade... this wonderful teacher said you didn't have to write a book report  you could just talk about the book  you could do a drawing of the book  you could write a play inspired by the book  and that's what I did.

I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker  put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table.

I have mostly been terrified of listening to scary stories around a campfire. We camp a lot as a family  and at night my dad would try and tell us scary stories. This made eating s'mores difficult.

Conservatives shouldn't count on the Supreme Court to do our work for us on Obamacare. The Court may rule as it should  and strike down the mandate. But it may not.

White people couldn't do black music back in the day because they weren't funky or bad enough. They weren't from the ghettoes  but hip-hop and R&ampB changed all of that because white kids want to be down with it. They wanted to learn it so they studied the culture.

People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at the time. I had to step away for the sake of the machine.

Now  do I think there has to be shared sacrifice among other nations in the world who want a stable and secure world? Absolutely  there has to be.

For me  titles are either a natural two-second experience or stressful enough to give you an ulcer. If they don't pop out perfect on the first try  they can be really hard to repair. Or  worse  if the author thinks they pop out perfect  but the publishing house does not agree  it's difficult to shift gears. And then? Then you go insane.;Sloane Crosley;experience                6,,,,,,,,,381

The breakdown of the black community  in order to maintain slavery  began with the breakdown of the black family.

Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that 'Oh  I don't get involved in politics ' as if that makes someone cleaner. No  that makes you derelict of duty in a republic.

Those who say we should dismantle the role of Poet Laureate altogether  the trick they miss is that being called this thing  with the weight of tradition behind it  and with the association of the Royal family  does allow you to have conversations and to open doors  and wallets  for the good of poetry in a way that nothing else would allow.;Andrew Motion;poetry                70,,,,,,,,,381

The truth is  the secular world isn't too enamored with Jesus. And they're not too enamored with someone who is leading people to Jesus.

It totally takes me back to those days  and it makes me smile every time I hear it.;Jason Aldean;smile                   62,,,,,,,,,382
I part of this great nation because my grandfather was born here  in Cincinnati  Ohio. He took a horse  back in 1895  and ride it all the way down to Guanajuato  looking for his American dream. No penny in his pocket  only dreams in his head. And he was an immigrant coming from the States into Mexico. And he found his American dream in Mexico.;Vicente Fox;dreams                64,,,,,,,,,382
Quite honestly I never had a desire to be an actor. I tell people  I did not choose acting acting chose me. I never grew up wanting to be an actor. I wanted to play football. In about 9th grade an English teacher told me I had a talent to act. He said I should audition for a performing arts high school so I did on a whim. I got accepted.;Ving Rhames;teacher                     65,,,,,,,,,382
You want to put out a TV show? If you have the money to do it on your own  by yourself  and you have a TV network  you can do it by yourself. But the nature of the beast is  art needs finance. That's how this industry works. So until the Internet becomes our source of entertainment - and watch it  I believe it will - this is how things go.;Nathan Fillion;nature                 73,,,,,,,,,382
Had the United States and the United Kingdom gone on alone to capture Baghdad  under the provisions of the Geneva and Hague conventions we would have been considered occupying powers and therefore would have been responsible for all the costs of maintaining or restoring government  education and other services for the people of Iraq.;Norman Schwarzkopf;alone                    77,,,,,,,,,382
Human beings want to be free and however long they may agree to stay locked up  to stay oppressed  there will come a time when they say 'That's it.' Suddenly they find themselves doing something that they never would have thought they would be doing  simply because of the human instinct that makes them turn their face towards freedom.;Aung San Suu Kyi;freedom                   78,,,,,,,,,382
I remember being at school during morning meeting and looking around at everybody  350 kids  saying a prayer. We're all very young and no one knows what it means  and I remember feeling strange that people were just repeating words that they didn't understand. I refused to participate. For some reason I always rejected it  but respectfully.;Sean Durkin;morning                  81,,,,,,,,,382
Here is my prescription to heal all wounds. Watch the film 'Funny Girl' at least five times  eat at least 45 chocolate bars  and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex. I truly believe that  through a combination of Nutella  old pals and Barbra Streisand  we can achieve happiness and  very probably  world peace.;Beth Ditto;happiness               91,,,,,,,,,382
Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt  and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics  haircuts  or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about.;Gerard Way;music                   91,,,,,,,,,382
There are 4 billion cell phones in use today. Many of them are in the hands of market vendors  rickshaw drivers  and others who've historically lacked access to education and opportunity. Information networks have become a great leveler  and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want.;Hillary Clinton;great                   93,,,,,,,,,382
I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker  put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start  but where you're going. That's family values.;Al Sharpton;family                    100,,,,,,,,,382
Without in any way minimising the economic and psychological blow that people experience when they lose their jobs  the unemployed in affluent countries still have a safety net  in the form of social security payments  and usually free healthcare and free education for their children. They also have sanitation and safe drinking water.;Peter Singer;experience                   114,,,,,,,,,382
I've never had a very closely connected family. My parents split up when I was young and I was living with my mom for a little while  then I was kind of just on my own really young. It wasn't some kind of global tragedy  it was just never really a very close-knit family. So there was support in the sense that they didn't stand in my way.;Ani DiFranco;family                    132,,,,,,,,,382
I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson  FDR  and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history. But  you know  but when it comes to the economy  we've got a lot more work to do. And we're gonna keep on at it.;Barack Obama;history                 149,,,,,,,,,382
'Aladdin' was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. 'Aladdin' was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys  which I loved. It wasn't a princess or a girl beating the odds it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.;Zachary Levi;amazing                     221,,,,,,,,,382
The message that I gave on the - on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual. Believe in the power of one person. Don't believe that you can't do it. Everybody wants - everybody wants a shot. That we can all agree on. Beyond that  it becomes politics. I'm not talking politics.;Glenn Beck;politics                     290,,,,,,,,,382
First play I ever did was 'Footloose.' I played the part of Willard when I was 16. I think I wore my drama teacher's jeans and her belt - that's how small I was. I know a lot of Willard's back story from the musical that's not explored in the film. Like he's got this whole relationship with his mama  and he sings this song 'Mama Says.';Miles Teller;teacher                     300,,,,,,,,,382
I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church's choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.;Katherine Jenkins;experience                      357,,,,,,,,,382
I think I'm a combination of very simple pleasures and the fact I've read a lot of books. I don't think it's a binary opposition across the board in humans and I think I'm an example that it's not. I'm hosting gay marriage rallies and I have tons of guns at home. There's a lot of middle ground in the world and I'm one of those people.;Dax Shepard;marriage                      357,,,,,,,,,382
Four years ago  I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have. We've blunted the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan  and in 2014  our longest war will be over. A new tower rises above the New York skyline  al Qaeda is on the path to defeat  and Osama bin Laden is dead.;Barack Obama;war                 14,,,,,,,,,383
I'm not only a lawyer  I have a post doctorate degree in federal tax law from William and Mary. I work in serious scholarship and work in the United States federal tax court. My husband and I raised five kids. We've raised 23 foster children. We've applied ourselves to education reform. We started a charter school for at-risk kids.;Michele Bachmann;education                     21,,,,,,,,,383
When I was a little kid  I wrote this play about all these characters living in a haunted house. There was a witch who lived there  and a mummy. When they were all hassling him  this guy who bought the house - I can't believe I remember this - he said to them  'Who's paying the mortgage on this haunted house?' I thought that was really funny.;Mindy Kaling;funny                  23,,,,,,,,,383
We get information in the mail  the regular postal mail  encrypted or not  vet it like a regular news organization  format it - which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do  when you're talking about giant databases of information - release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.;Julian Assange;legal                 30,,,,,,,,,383
In religious and in secular affairs  the more fervent beliefs attract followers. If you are a moderate in any respect - if you're a moderate on abortion  if you're a moderate on gun control  or if you're a moderate in your religious faith - it doesn't evolve into a crusade where you're either right or wrong  good or bad  with us or against us.;Jimmy Carter;faith                 35,,,,,,,,,383
The breakdown of the black community  in order to maintain slavery  began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldn't have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river.;Kerry Washington;women                    36,,,,,,,,,383
Julia progresses from cradle to grave  showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible. The weak economy  high unemployment  falling wages  rising gas prices  the national debt  the insolvency of entitlements - all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them.;Mitt Romney;good                37,,,,,,,,,383
I'm a better person in a relationship  and I'm a happier person. I need to come home at the end of the day and have it not be about me and my freaking hair and makeup and character motivations anymore. And I think my work is more inspired when home is safe and sound and solid  because what I do for a living is so bananas and so insecure.;Ginnifer Goodwin;home                    37,,,,,,,,,383
Marriage of attraction is a gamble anyway  so you might as well marry into a family that is similar to your own  and make that much less of an adjustment. But the 'love marriage'  as it is called  is equally common in India now. But it would be interesting to do a comparison of what would work better. Marriage is hard work  and it is a gamble.;Mira Nair;marriage                 41,,,,,,,,,383
And regardless of the fact that in this country  certainly in the arts  we treat comedy as a second-class citizen  I've never thought of it that way. I've always thought it to be important. The last time I looked  the Greeks were holding up two masks. I've always thought of it not only as having equal value  but as the craft of it  being funny.;Jeff Daniels;funny                47,,,,,,,,,383
To protect people's lives and keep our children safe  we must implement public-works spending and do so proudly. If possible  I'd like to see the Bank of Japan purchase all of the construction bonds that we need to issue to cover the cost. That would also forcefully circulate money in the market. That would be positive for the economy  too.;Shinzo Abe;positive                   52,,,,,,,,,383
When I joined Bill Clinton's start-up presidential campaign in 1991  I was confident that women would play an ever more important role  but I never gave a minute's thought to what would happen if we won. When we did - and I became the first woman to serve as White House press secretary - it changed my life. But it didn't change the world.;Dee Dee Myers;change                    67,,,,,,,,,383
I carry my own film guys with me now. People think that's a huge expense  but with technology like it is these days  it's not. You can film videos and everything with a Canon Mark II  and shoot a movie. They're doing it for next to nothing  by comparison. I can do ten videos for a project for the price of one mainstream video in the past.;Ronnie Dunn;technology                  72,,,,,,,,,383

The United Nations four or five years ago put out a study that said the meat industry  meat-eating  growing meat for food is the No. 1 killer of our planet - not No. 2 or No. 3: No 1.

When I said a few weeks ago that our people would eat cooking oil and olives if necessary  I didn't mean that there really would be only oil and olives.

I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually  I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid  too  and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me  a lot of passion for me.

I've been saying for a couple of years now that people need to let God out of the Sunday morning box  that He doesn't want to just be with you for an hour or two on Sunday morning and then put back in His box to sit there until you have an emergency  but He wants to invade your Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  and Sunday.;Joyce Meyer;morning              100,,,,,,,,,383
When first starting to work with someone you try to get them in the same mindset that you were in when you were successful  and I realized the best thing you can ever do is realize that they are not you.

The job numbers are positive. We've had more jobs created now than were lost during the recession.

I've been trying to learn how to not be so conflicted about things like my own anger.

I was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom.

There's only so far you can take a relationship before you got to get into things that are too serious or over the top. I'm 20 years old. I was in a relationship with a girl I love for three years.

Perhaps one of the most important things you can do for human beings is wean them off an animal-based diet. It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs. The last thing a poor person can afford is a heart attack or cancer or a stroke. And that's all linked to a meat-based diet. I think animal liberation is human liberation.;Ingrid Newkirk;diet                      358,,,,,,,,,383

See  the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it  the bitter honesty  is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary.

You know  it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things  it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles  telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective.

But you see  our society is still trapped in this binary  black/white logic and that has had some very positive implications for our generation.

If you want to be an entrepreneur  it's not a job  it's a lifestyle. It defines you.

The key is just to ignore the pain  because physical comedy only works if you see someone get hurt and they aren't actually hurt. If someone gets hit in the face with a bat  falls down  and gets back up  it's funny. If they stay down and their jaw is wired shut in the next scene  it's really tragic and weird. You have to pretend it doesn't hurt.;Chris Pratt;funny                 34,,,,,,,,,384
Abraham Lincoln comes from nothing  has no education  no money  lives in the middle of nowhere on the frontier.

When we were doing 'Freaks and Geeks'  I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked  and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me.

When I came to the CIA in the mid-'90s  our graduating class of case officers was unbelievably low.

I never set out to become 'famous.' I mean  when you're 14 you think 'I'm gonna become a writer and people will want my autograph and that'll be cool ' but you grow up and you learn that's just not how the world works.

Or Chloe Sevigny  because I really love that sort of classic look  and I like being girly and flowery  and wearing little D&ampG dresses. I wear hats a lot  too. I think it goes back to when I was a bit grungy and was a skater girl for a bit.;Ellie Goulding;amazing                 67,,,,,,,,,384
Movies always are open to being remade because times change so much  and the tempo of movies changes. I think of it like a James Bond. They can have different actors play the same role... I've had people come up to me and say  'We want to remake 'The Jerk' with so and so.' And I say  'Fine.' It just doesn't bother me. It's an honor actually.;Steve Martin;change                   67,,,,,,,,,384

You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art  we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich  when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war  literature was careful not to do the same  which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.;Michael Haneke;war                  68,,,,,,,,,384
No matter how popular you are as a stand-up - you can go out and fill a 10 000-seat arena and be smart and funny - it's delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that it's not about you  that it's about the people who are nominated  and respect that  but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are.;Ellen DeGeneres;funny                  74,,,,,,,,,384
You may never learn the names of any of the people you talk to in a dog park  even after many  many hours spent there with them  and many hours of conversation. But if - knock on wood - anything should ever happen to your dog  these nameless non-strangers will rally  sympathize  offer to help  and hold your hand. I know this from experience.;Susan Orlean;experience               76,,,,,,,,,384
The United Nations four or five years ago put out a study that said the meat industry  meat-eating  growing meat for food is the No. 1 killer of our planet - not No. 2 or No. 3: No 1. You know what's No. 2? Transportation. Everyone thinks that No. 1 is transportation  and goes out and buys a hybrid car. Screw the hybrid cars. Don't eat hamburgers.;Maggie Q;food                   85,,,,,,,,,384
Somewhere between 50 to 60 percent of the food you eat has been touched by immigrant hands  and it is fair to say some of them are not here as they should be here. But if you didn't have these folks  you would be spending a lot more - three  four or five times more - for food  or we would have to import food and have all the food security risks.;Tom Vilsack;food                  90,,,,,,,,,384
I watched a lot of silent directors who were absolutely great like John Ford and Fritz Lang  Tod Browning  and also some very modern directors like The Coen Brothers. The directors take the freedom within their own movies to be melodramatic or funny when they chose to be. They do whatever they want and they don't care about the genre.;Michel Hazanavicius;funny                    91,,,,,,,,,384
There are 4 billion cell phones in use today. Many of them are in the hands of market vendors  rickshaw drivers  and others who've historically lacked access to education and opportunity.

Learning how to get in tune with your field of energy and understand how to create your energy  expand that energy  and move that energy through your body.

It's possible that the 2012 general-election race will be the least overtly religious one since 1972  the last campaign before Roe v. Wade and the rise of Jimmy Carter brought evangelicalism into the political mainstream. That's because faith remains a complicated issue for Obama  who is still wrongly thought to be a Muslim in some quarters.;Jon Meacham;faith                    100,,,,,,,,,384
There was a big drive when I was at art school to make you aware of the economy of meaning - after all  this was still during the tail end of minimalism. Being responsible for everything you put in your picture  and being able to defend it. Keeping everything clear around you so you know what is operating. To open the wound and keep it clean.;Jane Campion;art                    102,,,,,,,,,384
The government has convinced parents that at some point it's no longer their responsibility. And in fact  they force them  in many respects  to turn their children over to the public education system and wrest control from them and block them out of participation of that. That has to change or education will not improve in this country.;Rick Santorum;education                   104,,,,,,,,,384
The type of leukemia that I am dealing with is treatable. So if I do what my doctors tell me to do - get my blood checked regularly  take my meds and consult with my doctor and follow any additional instructions he might make - I will be able to maintain my good health and live my life with a minimum of disruptions to my lifestyle.;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar;health                     131,,,,,,,,,384
I was very aware of office politics because I was so baffled by them. So much so goes unsaid. No one says 'you're a cheeky so-and-so ' no one says 'you're so moody ' nobody ever confronts anyone else about anything. But I'm very crass  and I'm very confrontational  and I have a temper. I had to be hyper-vigilant in every office I worked in.;Denise Mina;politics                  132,,,,,,,,,384
I'm an independent. I'm a centrist. A new generation is arriving that has grown up with a multiplicity of choice in every aspect of their lives  and yet politics is the last place that they are told that they should be satisfied with a choice between brand A and brand B. It doesn't fit the way they think. It doesn't fit the way they live.;John Avlon;politics                     143,,,,,,,,,384
It's really cool to know that you've put something together that isn't for a particular audience. It's so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population  and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.;David Krumholtz;knowledge                     178,,,,,,,,,384
I think people are born bisexual and the make subconscious choices based on the pressures of society. I have no question in my mind about being bisexual. But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who is bisexual  because that means they also sleep with men  and men are so dirty that I'd never sleep with a girl who had slept with a man.;Megan Fox;men                    221,,,,,,,,,384
I spend up to two hours a day on correspondence. Hearing from fans on the Internet and being able to directly respond to the fan base is exciting. You can cut out the middle man like the fan club... before a recent appearance in Tyler  Texas  I had fans reaching out on MySpace offering their lake house  Mavericks tickets. It was amazing.;Josh Henderson;amazing                   234,,,,,,,,,384
I never remember having a plan. All I could think about was how I was going to afford to get into college or where I was going to stay because I hated being at home. I didn't really have time to think about anything in the future. I didn't think about a career or anything. I went to uni  got a couple of jobs  so I sort of funded it myself.;Ellie Goulding;home                    287,,,,,,,,,384
I mean  I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don't do that every time  then you're considered a failure. But it's like  'Well  are you making movies to be successful? Or are you making movies to learn something?';Kristen Stewart;home                  6,,,,,,,,,385
Every night  half an hour before curtain up  the bells of St. Malachy's  the Actors' Chapel on New York's 49th Street  peal the tune of 'There's No Business Like Show Business.' If you walk the streets of the theatre district before a show and see the vast  enthusiastic lines it sounds like a calling: there is certainly no place like Broadway.;Dan Stevens;business                 11,,,,,,,,,385
But you see  our society is still trapped in this binary  black/white logic and that has had some very positive implications for our generation. It's had some very negative ones as well and one of the negative ones is that it creates enormous identity problems for people who have one black ancestor and all white ancestors for example.;Henry Louis Gates;positive                    11,,,,,,,,,385
As somebody who  in my second marriage  insisted on a prenuptial agreement  I can also testify that sometimes it is an act of love to chart the exit strategy before you enter the union  in order to make sure that not only you  but your partner as well  knows that there will be no World War III should hearts and minds  for any sad reason  change.;Elizabeth Gilbert;sad              15,,,,,,,,,385

With our technology  with objects  literally three people in a garage can blow away what 200 people at Microsoft can do. Literally can blow it away.

When I was doing 'Scarface ' I remember being in love at that time. One of the few times in my life. And I was so glad it was at that time. I would come home and she would tell me about her life that day and all her problems and I remember saying to her  look  you really got me through this picture because I would shed everything when I came home.;Al Pacino;home                   26,,,,,,,,,385
Well I was eight years old  and I have an older cousin who is three years older than me and she was doing acting  commercials  and modeling at the time and... to see my cousin doing that was really inspiring and I wanted to do it.

When it comes to locations  I'm one of those crazy authors who has to see it  touch it  taste it  before I trust myself to recreate it for my readers.

Bad acting comes in many bags  various odors. It can be performed by cardboard refugees from an Ed Wood movie  reciting their dialogue off an eye chart  or by hopped-up pros looking to punch a hole through the fourth wall from pure ballistic force of personality  like Joe Pesci in a bad mood. I can respect bad acting that owns its own style.;James Wolcott;respect                  29,,,,,,,,,385
In religious and in secular affairs  the more fervent beliefs attract followers. If you are a moderate in any respect - if you're a moderate on abortion  if you're a moderate on gun control  or if you're a moderate in your religious faith - it doesn't evolve into a crusade where you're either right or wrong  good or bad  with us or against us.;Jimmy Carter;respect                 35,,,,,,,,,385
My parents are artists in their world  in the world of modern artists  you are supposed to just go into your studio and tune everything out  and your entire relationship with your work is supposed to be a super private one.

And I love that even in the toughest moments  when we're all sweating it - when we're worried that the bill won't pass  and it seems like all is lost - Barack never lets himself get distracted by the chatter and the noise.

Marriage is a lot of things - a source of love  security  the joy of children  but it's also an interpersonal battlefield  and it's not hard to see why: Take two disparate people  toss them together in often-confined quarters  add the stresses of money and kids - now lather  rinse  repeat for the rest of your natural life. What could go wrong?;Jeffrey Kluger;marriage              46,,,,,,,,,385
But if our nation goes over a financial Niagara  we won't have much strength and  eventually  we won't have peace. We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors.

All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners  the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture)  the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog  and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism  idealism  and fantasy.;Jerry Saltz;amazing                 53,,,,,,,,,385
Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last  we need to focus on middle-class families.

I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously  and I would  I think  be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up.

The British are supposed to be particularly averse to intellectuals  a prejudice closely bound up with their dislike of foreigners. Indeed  one important source of this Anglo-Saxon distaste for highbrows and eggheads was the French revolution  which was seen as an attempt to reconstruct society on the basis of abstract rational principles.;Terry Eagleton;society                   67,,,,,,,,,385
What I'm not saying is that all government spending is bad. It's not - far  far from it  but there is no free lunch  as a former colleague of mine used to say. There is no public tooth fairy.

You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say  'You're a sellout  because you're doing something other than what you should be doing.' 'Top Chef' is a double-edged sword for me: There's a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I'm not in them anymore  all I do is TV.;Tom Colicchio;age                   84,,,,,,,,,385
Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt  and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics  haircuts  or what was cool.

This is what music is about.;Gerard Way;politics                   91,,,,,,,,,385
It seems to me that one thing people do over and over again is try to figure out how to get married  stay married  fall in love  how to rekindle all this stuff. It seems to me to be a pretty eternal theme so I don't know if you can get typecast from making movies about men relating to women. It seems to be what is going on on the planet a lot.;John Cusack;movies                   99,,,,,,,,,385
I think any new technology that helps connect and create social cohesion is great. But at the end of the day  you and I are analog creatures. We have to take 'oohs and aahs' and convert them to 0s and 1s and then convert them back to 'oohs and aahs.'

I'm Method trained. How is this character like me? What does she think of her mother? What does her mother think of her?

Obama seemed poised to realign American politics after his stunning 2008 victory.

The new industries are brainy industries and so-called knowledge workers tend to like to be near other people who are the same. Think of the City of Hollywood. People cluster. This means you have winning regions  such as London and Cambridge  and losing regions.

The great thing about baseball is the causality is easy to determine and it always falls on the shoulders of one person. So there is absolute responsibility.

And so when I moved to IBM  I moved because I thought I could apply technology. I didn't actually have to do my engineer - I was an electrical engineer  but I could apply it.

If you go and talk to most people  they mean well but they don't have much of a breadth on education  of knowledge of understanding what the real issues are and therefore they listen to pundits on television who tell them what they are supposed to think and they keep repeating that until pretty soon they say  'Oh  well that must be true.';Benjamin Carson;education                  33,,,,,,,,,386

Motherhood is a great honor and privilege  yet it is also synonymous with servanthood. Every day women are called upon to selflessly meet the needs of their families.

In my early 20s I was so miserable doing construction  I wanted something that paid money. I liked nice stuff. I liked cars and architecture  and things that cost money.

It's always nice to see something going up if I want to find something on Nathan Fillion  I do know where to look  but I've got a nice little delivery system in my mom.;Nathan Fillion;mom                   108,,,,,,,,,386
I made some friends at Listerine and they taught me a little bit about oral care. That half of adults suffer from oral disease  that the number one chronic disease among children is oral disease  that we're only taking care of 25% of our mouths when brushing alone and there are more germs in your mouth than there are people on the planet.;Ginnifer Goodwin;alone                    126,,,,,,,,,386
The writing is really hard. You're alone. It really pulls it out of you. You pull it out of your head. But when you're a director  you're shopping - you're picking this actor  you're picking this scene. It's like the most intense kinetic high-speed shopping of all time. You sit in a chair and it will all come rushing at you like a wind tunnel.;Tony Gilroy;alone                    129,,,,,,,,,386
The people of Wisconsin have been good to me. I've tried to live up to their trust. And now I ask those hardworking men and women  and millions like them across America  to join our cause and get this country working again. When Governor Romney asked me to join the ticket  I said  'Let's get this done' - and that is exactly  what we're going to do.;Paul Ryan;trust                 129,,,,,,,,,386

What we're doing is making sure that we have a safe and secure border region from San Diego all the way to Brownsville. And that means manpower  it means technology  it means infrastructure  it means interior enforcement. All  you know  kind of layered in appropriate ways  and making sure  like I said before  the border is safe and secure.;Janet Napolitano;technology              143,,,,,,,,,386
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love.

We are all used to paying a sales tax when we buy things - almost 9 percent here in New York City. The application of this concept to the financial sector could solve our need for revenue  bring some sanity back into the financial sector  and give us a way to raise the revenue we need to run the government in a fiscally responsible way.;Eliot Spitzer;government                    187,,,,,,,,,386
The best plan now is to have as many bosses as possible. I call it boss diversity. If you work for a company and you have one boss and that boss doesn't like you or wants to get rid of you  you're in trouble. But if you work for yourself  you have lots of bosses  who are your customers  and if a few of them decide they don't like you  that's okay.;Scott Adams;best                 188,,,,,,,,,386

There was a study done in the early 20th century of all the entrepreneurs who entered the automobile industry around the same time as Henry Ford there were something like 500 automotive companies that got funded  had the internal combustion engine  had the technology  and had the vision.

One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people  I inspire the public  I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.;Herman Cain;inspirational                    233,,,,,,,,,386
I've just finished my 20th book this past year and I'm working on my 21st book about the Middle East right now that I'll finish this year. And I get up early in the morning and when I get tired of the computer and tired of doing research  I walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and I either build furniture or paint paintings. I'm an artist too.;Jimmy Carter;morning                     237,,,,,,,,,386
What I was going for in the first two albums I didn't necessarily achieve. Because I was young and because it was my first time out. And the second album was such a 'quickie' sort of 'Let's just get it over with!' But the kind of music I make  there's a lot of subtlety in it. And I think it takes a couple of listens to actually really get it.;Norah Jones;music                     242,,,,,,,,,386
Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there's a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt. The reason is that it's really  really hard  and too many of us in too many spheres of life choose the easy over the hard.;Jon Meacham;diet                    254,,,,,,,,,386
I was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom. They have the gratification of intense interest: the authorities want to put them in jail  while there are younger readers for whom what they write is pure oxygen.;Tom Stoppard;freedom                     267,,,,,,,,,386
This career essentially chased me down while I was on the spoken-word scene in New York. I kept hearing that my delivery of my poetry - which was very personal and cathartic at the time- was very moving to folks. People thought that I was an actress because of my delivery  when I was just dropping into the work and really pouring out my soul.;Sonja Sohn;poetry                     272,,,,,,,,,386
I never remember having a plan. All I could think about was how I was going to afford to get into college or where I was going to stay because I hated being at home. I didn't really have time to think about anything in the future. I didn't think about a career or anything. I went to uni  got a couple of jobs  so I sort of funded it myself.;Ellie Goulding;future                    287,,,,,,,,,386
I mean  I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don't do that every time  then you're considered a failure. But it's like  'Well  are you making movies to be successful? Or are you making movies to learn something?';Kristen Stewart;movies                  6,,,,,,,,,387
For President Obama  'home of the brave' are not just the last words of our national anthem  but also a call to action. This is why the president's policies and our platform include incentives to train and hire our troops returning home. Not only because of our moral responsibility  but because it makes for a stronger  more secure American economy.;Cory Booker;home                  19,,,,,,,,,387
I understand why society  especially American society  is gravitating toward fairy tales  given our economy. We've been exploring the world of witches and wizards for years. We've been exploring the world of vampires for years.

I have been blessed in many ways  and one of those is to have been born in Africa  for me a great treasure house of stories.

I write almost entirely from my own experience.;Wilbur Smith;experience                  32,,,,,,,,,387
Motherhood is a great honor and privilege  yet it is also synonymous with servanthood. Every day women are called upon to selflessly meet the needs of their families.

When you first have a baby your life doesn't change. I mean  you have a little less sleep and you drag these cuddly things around you and it's just amazing. But you still get to be you.

I think its rather peculiar. It's not in keeping with our founding documents  our founding vision. But I'd guess you'd have to ask the Obama administration why they purged all this language from their platform. There sure is a lot of mention of government  so I guess I would put the onus on them to answer why they did all these purges of God.;Paul Ryan;government                    76,,,,,,,,,387

When I said a few weeks ago that our people would eat cooking oil and olives if necessary  I didn't mean that there really would be only oil and olives.

It is time for corporate America to become 'the third pillar' of social change in our society  complementing the first two pillars of government and philanthropy.

We've demonstrated a strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket  we don't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions.

I've covered a lot of ground geographically and emotionally and for years I lost my connection with my family.

The mindset of chasing that next #1 record doesn't exist for me anymore. It's more about being a well-rounded entertainer than being a pop artist. Obviously  it would be wonderful to have a hit record but I don't base my happiness on that anymore. It's about the accomplishment of a project that satisfies me. I just want to enjoy the ride.;Donny Osmond;happiness                     156,,,,,,,,,387
While Free Choice Vouchers didn't fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every American would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company  they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for Americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their family's health insurance costs.;Ron Wyden;family                     159,,,,,,,,,387

I spend so much time with the brightest and most talented and well-rounded people. I've had the privilege of having long and very intellectual conversations with people  and sometimes I just sit there and listen. It's like a better version of a class.

I'm never overawed by a situation and I think that's because I've always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29  I've always felt in control of a situation. People used to say  when you're 32  you'll look 32.

And so I look at it as a relationship that I have with him that I want to give him the honor and glory anytime I have the opportunity.

First play I ever did was 'Footloose.' I played the part of Willard when I was 16. I think I wore my drama teacher's jeans and her belt - that's how small I was. I know a lot of Willard's back story from the musical that's not explored in the film.

I drank for about 25 years getting over the loss of my father and I took the anger out on myself. I did a good job at beating myself up at sometimes. I don't drink anymore but my alcoholic head occasionally says different.

I never feel so utterly fraudulent as when I review a movie whose charms impress all in the world and I simply do not get it. The other variant is that I love something the world disdains.

As somebody who  in my second marriage  insisted on a prenuptial agreement  I can also testify that sometimes it is an act of love to chart the exit strategy before you enter the union  in order to make sure that not only you  but your partner as well  knows that there will be no World War III should hearts and minds  for any sad reason  change.;Elizabeth Gilbert;change              15,,,,,,,,,388
If you're married  and you have a wife  and you really love your wife  is it good enough to only say to your wife 'I love her' the day you get married?

Before I was married  I didn't consider my failure to manage even basic hand tools a feminist inadequacy. I thought it had more to do with being Jewish. The Jews I knew growing up didn't do 'do-it-yourself.'

On the political front  of course it's a zero-sum game. If it's all white males holding positions  you bring 10 women in  then it's  'Women are coming!' Get 10 blacks and it's  'Blacks are coming!'

Abraham Lincoln comes from nothing  has no education  no money  lives in the middle of nowhere on the frontier.

Imagine it's 1981. You're an artist  in love with art  smitten with art history. You're also a woman  with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn't that into you.

I was really bright as a kid and tested well  and it was clear that I was going to get scholarships to any schools I wanted.

But if our nation goes over a financial Niagara  we won't have much strength and  eventually  we won't have peace. We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors.

What I believe is that marriage is between a man and a woman  but what I also believe is that we have an obligation to make sure that gays and lesbians have the rights of citizenship that afford them visitations to hospitals  that allow them to be  to transfer property between partners  to make certain that they're not discriminated on the job.;Barack Obama;marriage                  60,,,,,,,,,388
I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry  so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it.

People who supported Obama felt like they formed a relationship  that they were being spoken to. The way that campaign worked and the way he's worked during his first term is to make people feel like he's grasping their hand  whether it's by tweeting or email  moments after an event  sometimes during an event. It makes people relate to him.;James Spader;relationship                  63,,,,,,,,,388
You don't know what someone's going to walk away from a movie with  but you hope it's something positive  but if nothing  you want them most basically to be entertained and engaged. That's your job.

If the amount of money going into the war economy were invested in landscape restoration  we would be in a far more positive position.

We say no to lots of things that would please us. I would like to punch people every now and then  but I don't. I would like to have something for free rather than pay for it.

There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing  even if short-term it was unpopular.

The message that President Obama delivered in his speech at Notre Dame was: morality is immoral. Pro-life is the extremist position  not a moral position.

I have not agreed with his every decision  but never once have I seen him break his cool  lose his composure  or abandon his insightful perspective - even during the most serious and/or absurd national disasters.;Elizabeth Gilbert;cool                   172,,,,,,,,,388
Customers don't know what they want. There's plenty of good psychology research that shows that people are not able to accurately predict how they would behave in the future. So asking them  'Would you buy my product if it had these three features?' or 'How would you react if we changed our product this way?' is a waste of time. They don't know.;Eric Ries;future                     189,,,,,,,,,388
All this stuff is so mind-blowing to me that I get to do in my life. Throwing the first pitch out at the White Sox game on a random Wednesday? Like who am I? How did I get this life? I'm glad I'm not jaded  and little kids are the least jaded people in the entire world  so it's fun to be around people that still find wonder in how cool things are.;Jonah Hill;cool                    205,,,,,,,,,388
I think people are born bisexual and the make subconscious choices based on the pressures of society. I have no question in my mind about being bisexual. But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who is bisexual  because that means they also sleep with men  and men are so dirty that I'd never sleep with a girl who had slept with a man.;Megan Fox;society                    221,,,,,,,,,388
Under Barack Obama  the only 'Change' is that 'Hope' has been hard to find. Now millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us by reminding us of what makes us special  he divides us against each other. He tells Americans they're worse off because others are better off. That people got rich by making others poor.;Marco Rubio;hope                    18,,,,,,,,,389
On the political front  of course it's a zero-sum game. If it's all white males holding positions  you bring 10 women in  then it's  'Women are coming!' Get 10 blacks and it's  'Blacks are coming!' 'Hispanics are coming!' Zero-sum game. The seatmates might change but the chairs don't move. In the economy  the number of chairs can actually increase.;Jesse Jackson;change                22,,,,,,,,,389
For the past several years  I have remained what others would consider underground. I did this in order to build a community of people  like-minded in their desire for freedom and the right to pursue their goals and lives without being manipulated and controlled by a media protected military industrial complex with a completely different agenda.;Lauryn Hill;freedom                    26,,,,,,,,,389
Julia progresses from cradle to grave  showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible. The weak economy  high unemployment  falling wages  rising gas prices  the national debt  the insolvency of entitlements - all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them.;Mitt Romney;government                37,,,,,,,,,389
And I love that even in the toughest moments  when we're all sweating it - when we're worried that the bill won't pass  and it seems like all is lost - Barack never lets himself get distracted by the chatter and the noise. Just like his grandmother  he just keeps getting up and moving forward... with patience and wisdom  and courage and grace.;Michelle Obama;patience                  44,,,,,,,,,389
There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing  even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.;Barack Obama;politics                     99,,,,,,,,,389
Don't reward bad behavior. It is one of the first rules of parenting. During the financial cataclysm of 2008  we said it differently. When we bailed out banks that had created their own misfortune  we called it a 'moral hazard ' because the bailout absolved the bank's bad acts and created an incentive for it to make the same bad loans again.;Eliot Spitzer;parenting                   108,,,,,,,,,389
It's interesting that I had such a close relationship with my grandfather. Because your parents always judge you: they say  'You shouldn't do this  you shouldn't do that.' But with your grandparents you have a feeling that you can say anything or you can do anything  and they will support you. That's why you have this kind of connection.;Novak Djokovic;relationship                   122,,,,,,,,,389
The message that President Obama delivered in his speech at Notre Dame was: morality is immoral. Pro-life is the extremist position  not a moral position. Yet we should compromise and work to reduce abortions.

When I was trying to impress Kate I was trying to cook these amazing fancy dinners and what would happen was I would burn something  something would overspill  something would catch on fire and she would be sitting in the background trying to help  and basically taking control of the whole situation  so I was quite glad she was there at the time.;Prince William;food                  131,,,,,,,,,389

It's harder to be funny if you're handsome than if you're very normal-looking. It's just more relatable. You're the underdog. I mean it's funny to see people struggle  and you don't buy that Brad Pitt is struggling  you know that guy could be the most skill-less guy in the world  but if you look like that you will be fine for the rest of your life.;Jonah Hill;funny                   166,,,,,,,,,389
I'm a lapsed Quaker. I don't go to meetings any more. But I'm very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter. I'd love to be a Catholic. I think it would be fantastic - faith  forgiveness  absolution  extreme unction - all these wonderful words.

Having played many roles of scientific intellect I do have an empathy for that world. It's been hard on me because flying the Enterprise for seven years in Star Trek and sitting in Cerebro in X-men has led people to believe that I know what I'm talking about.

For the first time we're allowing developers who don't work at Facebook to develop applications just as if they were. That's a big deal because it means that all developers have a new way of doing business if they choose to take advantage of it.

As somebody who  in my second marriage  insisted on a prenuptial agreement  I can also testify that sometimes it is an act of love to chart the exit strategy before you enter the union  in order to make sure that not only you  but your partner as well  knows that there will be no World War III should hearts and minds  for any sad reason  change.;Elizabeth Gilbert;marriage              15,,,,,,,,,390
With our technology  with objects  literally three people in a garage can blow away what 200 people at Microsoft can do. Literally can blow it away.

Individual psychotherapy - that is  engaging a distressed fellow human in a disciplined conversation and human relationship - requires that the therapist have the proper temperament and philosophy of life for such work. By that I mean that the therapist must be patient  modest  and a perceptive listener  rather than a talker and advice-giver.;Thomas Szasz;relationship                  34,,,,,,,,,390
I forget what the relevant American rate is  but I can tell you that our goal is to have a combined federal-provincial corporate tax rate of no more than 25 percent. We're on target to do that by 2012.

More than five million seniors have already saved money on their prescription drugs  and almost 33 million have benefited from free preventive services.

With the song 'This Christmas' I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean  Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist.

It is time for corporate America to become 'the third pillar' of social change in our society  complementing the first two pillars of government and philanthropy.

I call on the Iranian people: it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious Persian heritage  a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles...

Even those who  like me  believe that Roe v.

My fellow Americans  you have to decide what kind of country you want to live in. If you want a you're on your own  winner take all society you should support the Republican ticket.

You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art  we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich  when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war  literature was careful not to do the same  which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.;Michael Haneke;experience                  68,,,,,,,,,391
Today 80 percent of all the oil that comes out of the Gulf is from 1 000 feet or more and today almost a third of it is more than 5 000 feet below the surface.

With the CGI  suddenly there's a thousand enemies instead of six - the army goes off into the horizon. You don't need that. The audience loses its relationship with the threat on the screen.

I've started to wonder if that's why I didn't get certain movies.;Jennifer Lawrence;movies                    61,,,,,,,,,393
If I go into a sandwich shop or anywhere that features 'Today's specials' on a chalkboard more than 10 feet away  I have to ask for a printed menu. I smile at people I don't know on the street and ignore those I do. When at home  I often find myself grabbing my 'back-up' glasses to search for the better-loved pair I have left on top of my dresser.;Sloane Crosley;smile                    112,,,,,,,,,393
I call on the Iranian people: it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious Persian heritage  a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles... How can a nation allow a regime to instill fear  take away the people's freedom and shock the young generation that seeks its way out of the dictatorial Iran.;Shimon Peres;freedom                    123,,,,,,,,,393
What I'm attempting to do is to show people that if I can spend some time with very dangerous spiders and snakes and scorpions  then maybe they'll feel different about the spiders and snakes they find around their areas. I don't need people to keep them as pets. I just like them to be respectful and see that everything in nature has its place.;Dominic Monaghan;nature                     126,,,,,,,,,393
It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. I don't think people have noticed that  but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use... The greens use guilt. That just shows how religious greens are. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting (carbon dioxide) in the air.;James Lovelock;religion                     129,,,,,,,,,393
Men can absent themselves from real life for their art more easily. Women are anchored into the quotidian business of getting food on the table  making sure everybody's socks match  the soccer gear is ready. I admire idealists  but they're usually enabled by someone who holds the tether on their balloon  who pays the bills and sweeps up after them.;Geraldine Brooks;food                  143,,,,,,,,,393
Most people should be talking about how Floyd Mayweather is a great undefeated future Hall of Famer that's his own promoter and that works extremely hard to get to where he's at. Instead  all you hear is hate and jealous remarks from critics who criticize me and  you know  most of the time  the people that criticize me can't do what I can do.;Floyd Mayweather  Jr.;future                 186,,,,,,,,,393
And so I look at it as a relationship that I have with him that I want to give him the honor and glory anytime I have the opportunity. And then right after I give him the honor and glory  I always try to give my teammates the honor and glory.

So let's not use a stylus. We're going to use the best pointing device in the world. We're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with - born with ten of them. We're going to use our fingers. We're going to touch this with our fingers. And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch  which is phenomenal.

I'm someone who loves to enjoy life and tries to focus on real things and real friendships. That's why I live very simply. I'm a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl.

For the first time we're allowing developers who don't work at Facebook to develop applications just as if they were. That's a big deal because it means that all developers have a new way of doing business if they choose to take advantage of it.

There are a lot of obstacles in the way of our understanding animal intelligence - not the least being that we can't even agree whether nonhuman species are conscious.

The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life. They can no longer even teach abstinence education.

We are a people that have always celebrated other people's success so long as we always had the opportunity to meet that success ourselves. That is the American nature. That is the American character. That is one of the things that makes us different from the rest of the world.

I'm actually reading 'World War Z' again! It's incredibly realistic and it's written as an oral history through interviews with different characters. Max Brooks wrote this book in so many different voices. There are about forty or so. It's incredible.

As an actor  you just want to work  and then you just want to be on a show or have a job that you love  and you hope that job will last - those things have happened.

I'm still very connected to my family  to the world I grew up in. I understand what it means to be afraid that you can't pay a doctor's bill. Or to have to make the choice between buying a band uniform for a seventh-grader and making the insurance payment on time. That will never leave me.

When I first started working in politics  as a junior aide on Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign  it never occurred to me that I would one day work in the White House.

I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically  so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination.

Would you like me to give you a formula for success? Its quite simple  really: Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isnt at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it  so go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember thats where you will find success. Thomas J.

I think that we had a different view of what the 21st century could be like  with much more of a sense  from our perspective  of trying to have an interdependent world: looking at solving regional conflicts  having strength in alliances  operating within some kind of a sense that we were part of the international community and not outside of it.;Madeleine Albright;strength                 75,,,,,,,,,394

I'm sure everything has a bearing on what I'm doing. My family is a lower-middle-class family  there's lots of children  seven brothers  two sisters grew up together  fighting with each other  went to school. My mother went to school up to 4th grade.

My father respected and admired my mother and was a person who was always standing by my side  encouraging me to do more and believed in my capacity.

So I never had any doubt that women can do a lot.;Michelle Bachelet;experience                   93,,,,,,,,,394
There is a split between Muslims who want to practice their faith in peace and tolerance with other religions and other people  and these extreme  radical fundamentalists who have shown a total lack of tolerance for people with different views  starting with people who they don't think are good Muslims  and going on to include Christians and Jews.;Richard Holbrooke;faith                  126,,,,,,,,,394

I mean the beauty of being a writer is it's not like being a swimmer. When they were talking about our Olympic swimmers and they'd say  'Oh she's so old ' and she's all of 25 or something.

We're understanding what Obama is. He is the great teacher. He is this guy that stands above everybody. There's some condescension in it  but he stands above everybody and says  'Now  listen.

My relationship with the journalists who covered the campaign was complicated.

We see tremendous excitement from small-business people about the administration and about the attention and commitment that the president has to do things that really make a difference.

You know  I think  I think the Palestinians are trying to get away without negotiating. They're trying to get a state to continue the conflict with Israel rather than to end it.

I think romance is friendship and attraction sort of meeting together and that does influence what I'm writing a lot.

I'm a lapsed Quaker. I don't go to meetings any more. But I'm very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter. I'd love to be a Catholic.

Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there's a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt.

Film is the manipulative medium par excellence. When you think back on the history of film and the 20th century  you see the propaganda that's been made.

Another time  I was shooting this indie film 'The Souler Opposite' and six days a week  I'm playing this big puppy dog  then I come to the 'NYPD Blue' set and become this scumbag.;Christopher Meloni;fear                  94,,,,,,,,,415
And I just think that we're at a point in our economic life here in our state - and - and  candidly  across the country  where increased taxes is just the wrong way to go. The people of our state are not convinced that state government  county government  local government has done all they can with the money we already give them  rather than the money that we have before.;Chris Christie;government                89,,,,,,,,,418
I grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world. I worry  because I don't think my kids are going to have that. The world is very scary. The world would be scary without the choices the current administration made  but they just exacerbated it. And it ticks me off. I want my kids to have a good life.;Bradley Whitford;family                    127,,,,,,,,,419
Your time is limited  so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important  have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. Steve Jobs                    20,,,,,,,,,421
The basic problem with my love relationships with women is that my standards are so high - and they apply equally to both of us. I seek full-blast mutual intensity  fully fledged mutual acceptance  full-blown mutual flourishing  and fully felt peace and joy with each other. This requires a level of physical attraction  personal adoration  and moral admiration that is hard to find.;Cornel West;peace                 163,,,,,,,,,421

A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises  I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body  it gives boldness  enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball  and others of that nature  are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks.;Thomas Jefferson;nature                 67,,,,,,,,,422
It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men  kindness and generosity  openness  honesty  understanding and feeling  are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest  sharpness  greed  acquisitiveness  meanness  egotism and self-interest  are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.;John Steinbeck;men           65,,,,,,,,,426

I'd do pretty much anything to get back on stage. I'd like to develop a new musical. I nearly had a heart attack when I heard that they're developing John Waters' Cry-Baby because that is so amazing and super and wonderful and I wish that I could be involved. But it's not the right time and I understand that. But I hear things like that and I get that little tingle in my stomach.;Kristen Bell;amazing                      403,,,,,,,,,428
When you become a mom you just learn how to function sleep deprived and you do get used to it. I came back to work when Finley was three months old and the first few months were rough. Then somehow you learn to exist on no sleep and now when he does upon occasion sleep through the night  which is like a full six hours  you're pretty sure he's suffocating. So you don't sleep anyway.;Holly Marie Combs;mom                    287,,,,,,,,,429
I liked the way my character  Shane  was first introduced. You get introduced to her through this sexual action  and I thought that was so cool and just kind of summed up what she enjoys and who she is  to a certain extent. She's a complete sexual being and the great thing is that she doesn't apologize for it. It's just who she is. We rarely see women be able to do that on television.;Katherine Moennig;cool                  28,,,,,,,,,430

I believe that science fiction is as profound as you want it to be or it can be very simple entertainment  and I'm all for very simple entertainment. Every now and then we all need to come home  veg-out  watch something and not think too deeply about it. It's what you want it to be. We tend to steer clear of being pedantic it's entertainment first  otherwise we'd be on a lecture circuit.;Joe Flanigan;science                  105,,,,,,,,,432
And in my own life  in my own small way  I've tried to give back to this country that has given me so much. That's why I left a job at a law firm for a career in public service  working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities. Because I believe that each of us - no matter what our age or background or walk of life - each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation.;Michelle Obama;age                   18,,,,,,,,,442
And what do Democrats stand for  if they are so ready to defame concerned citizens as the 'mob' - a word betraying a Marie Antoinette delusion of superiority to ordinary mortals. I thought my party was populist  attentive to the needs and wishes of those outside the power structure. And as a product of the 1960s  I thought the Democratic party was passionately committed to freedom of thought and speech.;Camille Paglia;power                   31,,,,,,,,,448

The fact is if we do our job right  if we keep worrying not about polls but about the jobs of the American people  about their health care  about their ability to educate their kids  stay in their homes and own their homes  send their kids to college  the basic pillars of a middle-class life  if we keep worrying about the future and building a stronger future for this country  these things will take care of themselves.;David Axelrod;health              34,,,,,,,,,459
I had never done anything with blue screen before  or prosthetics  or anything like that. Lord of the Rings was like stepping into a videogame for me. It was another world completely. But  to be honest  I basically did it so that I could have the ears. I thought they would really work with my bare head.Working with Martin Scorsese was an absolute minute-by-minute education without him ever being grandiose about it.;Cate Blanchett;education                  49,,,,,,,,,463
Mostly  when you see programmers  they arent doing anything.  One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.  Very often theyre sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping  or just staring into space.  What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.     Charles M. Strauss                   6,,,,,,,,,475
The pace of change for entrepreneurs is rapidly accelerating  and the cost and risk of launching a new business and getting off the ground is just amazing. The ability to gain user feedback really quickly and adapt to what your consumers want is totally different with the web as it is now. But finding a new market  helping people and taking that original idea and turning it into a business is really exciting right now.

The gays like 'Project Runway' because it's a fashion  and the gays are into fashion and into design. It's a creative industry  and most of the gays are pretty creative  in general. That's just like the culture. We're not all into politics necessarily. We're more into the creative environment. I also think Heidi is a big draw. The boys love Heidi and think she's so fabulous. I just think it's a glitzy  fun show  and there are also always lots of gay boys on it  and  you know  that's fun.;Christian Siriano;design              53,,,,,,,,,533

Ford's success has startled the country  almost the world  financially  industrially  mechanically.  It exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency  which are:  constant increase of quality  great increase of pay to the workers  repeated reduction in cost to the consumer.  And with these appears  as at once cause and effect  an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years  and an enormous profit to the manufacturer.  ~Charles Buxton Going            39,,,,,,,,,606
For all of the most important things  the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesnt conspire against you  but it doesnt go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. Someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If its important to you and you want to do it eventually  just do it and correct course along the way. Timothy Ferriss  author of The 4-Hour Work Week                 36,,,,,,,,,615
A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out  after innumerable punching  an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.(IEEE Grid newsmagazine)                     96,,,,,,,,,622
